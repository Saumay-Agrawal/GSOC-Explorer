0,Science and Medicine,"The 3D Toolkit is a collection of programs that allow working with 3D point cloud data. The tools include a powerful and efficient 3D point cloud viewer called ""show"" which is able to open point clouds containing millions of points even on older graphics cards while still providing high frame rates. It provides bindings for ROS, the Robotic Operating System and for Python, the programming language. Most of the functionality of 3DTK is provided in the form of ""tools"", hence the name which are executed on the command line. These tools are able to carry out operations like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), plane detection, transformations, surface normal computation, feature detection and extraction, collision detection and dynamic object removal. We support Linux, Windows and MacOS. 3DTK contains the implementation of several complex algorithms like multiple SLAM and ICP implementations as well as several data structures like k-d trees, octrees, sphere quadtrees and voxel grids. The software is home of the implementation of algorithms from several high impact research papers. While the Point Cloud Library (PCL) might be dead, 3DTK is alive and actively maintained by an international team of skilled researchers from all over the world, ranging from Europe to China. Know-how from 3DTK influenced several businesses from car manufacturers to mineral excavation or archaeological projects.",None,http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5bb1zuSJfNaskJVgD5jO4Mdzamk1udiUH1BXVSzMcM8fB-kIy62kBFS6MtQj1EW445ZkQ1BWlvJL2oXRJNqsYBcmPWpSXng,nan,3DTK,2,The 3D Toolkit provides algorithms and methods to process 3D point clouds,c/c++,cmake,opencv,ros,boost,3d,point clouds,slam,robotics,mapping,http://threedtk.de,2018,nan

These efforts include the compilation and rescue of legacy soil profile data, new data collection and analysis, and system development for large-scale soil mapping using remote sensing imagery and crowdsourced ground observations. The project area includes ~17.5 million km2 of continental sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), encompassing more than 90% of Africaâ€™s human population living in 42 countries. The project area excludes hot and cold desert regions based on the recently revised KÃ¶ppen-Geiger climate classification, as well as the non-desert areas of Northern Africa. AfSIS is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and is supported by close scientific, operational and implementation partnerships with an ever-growing list ofÂ scientific organizations. The project, in addition, works with a wide range of stakeholders across multiple scales as it seeks to develop demand driven products and services, support the institutional development of national soil services and build capacity and awareness for the improved management of natural resources. As such, AfSIS has established key partnerships with the governments of Nigeria, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Ghana and continues to work closely with a number of international bodies through the Global Soil Consortium as well as government research and academic institutions in East Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, Oceania, and South America and the CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE) which combines the resources of 11 CGIAR Centers, The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and numerous international, regional and national partners.",nan,nan,http://qed.ai/afsis-gsoc,Africa Soil Information Service,2,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2015,https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2015/orgs/afsis/logo-200.png

1267,nan,"Mailing List: mailto:gsoc@astrometry.net   Astrometry = ""astro"" (celestial objects) + ""metry"" (measurement) Astrometry is the branch of astronomy that deals with measuring the positions and motions of celestial objects (stars, galaxies, planets, comets, and so on). Astrometry.net is a project and our goal is to allow astronomers of all levels (professional researchers, tech savvy amateurs, and backyard stargazers) to share and learn from each other's astronomical images. A barrier that we are trying to eliminate is the problem of calibrating images -- figuring out the properties of the camera and where it was pointing, so that we can make sense of the image. We have built an ""astrometry engine"" -- a piece of code that can recognize the celestial objects in an astronomical image and figure out where the camera was pointing. You take a picture of the night sky, and our software can automatically figure out where your camera (or telescope) was pointing, based on the geometric arrangement of the stars in the image. It's a computer vision system that *works* -- a cool trick! Exactly what does the astrometry engine produce? A mapping, or transformation, between image coordinates and sky coordinates. Does it work? Yeah! The system can recognize 100% of the 300,000+ images in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We have been running a web service for over three years and have successfully recognized tens of thousands of images. We also run a group on flickr -- the images submitted to the group automatically get fed into the astrometry engine and tags are added to the images identifying their contents. Professional observatories and amateur astronomers are using our code for pointing their telescopes and analyzing the results. We've got a strong technical base, but we want your help to expand our operations, improve our web presence (build a web service that doesn't look like the ugliest thing on the web in 1994!), build a community, reach out to a broader user base (eg, build a tool that lets you plug a digital camera into your laptop and tells you where to point it to find stuff in the sky), and do cool things with the collection of images our users have assembled (build a dynamic map of the sky and a list of the objects in it).",nan,nan,http://trac.astrometry.net/wiki/CodingProjects,Astrometry.net,2,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2011,nan

Audacity has been translated into almost 30 languages, and nearly half of Audacity users use it in a language other than English. Perhaps most importantly, Audacity has a well established developer community. There are no full-time developers, but about a dozen team members who have been with the project for several years act as the leaders of the community, setting the direction and coordinating releases. Dozens of developers have contributed many features, bug fixes, and other patches. Hundreds of others participate on the mailing lists, and help test and track down bugs. In addition, dozens of volunteers help with documentation, technical support, language translation, community support, and more.

Some of our best contributions have come from young developers with very little prior experience.

It is one of the most successful and sustained cross-platform open source games ever with an active developer, administrative, and player community. There have been more than a million downloads in the last five years alone and our user base presently consists of more than 200 players online at any time of day or night. The project has actually become more popular over the years as we continue to improve and enhance the game.  BZFlag has been under active development since 1992.  Our organization is presently comprised of a rather disparate group of individuals that work on BZFlag because they love the game and the community that surrounds it. Our developer base presently consists of core developers that have made extensive contributions to the game and remained active over many years, along with many apprentice-level developers that are coming up in the ranks, and various peripheral/casual developers, extension developers, and web integration programmers. Additionally, there are trusted staffers, server operators, and graphic artists that assist in the day-to-day operations needed by the game for keeping servers up and running, providing server list services, designing artwork, providing network statistics, image hosting, web hosting, and much more.  All of our project developers almost exclusively collaborate on the #bzflag Freenode IRC channel, which is the central hub for most of our development discussions, decision planning meetings, game operations, and network infrastructure administration. We operate via a benevolent dictatorship combined with a meritocracy that strives for consensus between the core developers and other involved community members.  Extensive discussions are held for any changes to BZFlag that affect the game's traditional spirit, mood of gameplay, tone of the user environment, and types of interactions possible in the game. These discussions also include considerations whenever there are new features being added such as new flags, enhanced graphics, or changes to the gameplay. We also serve as a support arm to our user community assisting them with anything from how to get started playing to providing assistance with setting up their own server or even helping them write their own new extensions to the game.  From IRC, we administer network operations across more than 250 public servers. As we are a globally distributed network-oriented game, we also maintain the public server listings, provide player tracking, network statistics, global authentication, user and group management, abuse and ban controls, player conflict resolution, competitive league management, and user community support.",nan,nan,http://my.bzflag.org/w/Google_Summer_of_Code/2009#Proposal_Ideas,BZFlag,4,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2009,nan
223,Programming Languages and Development Tools,"Babel helps you write the latest version of JavaScript, and is helping shape the future of the language itself. It's used at Facebook, Google, Netflix, and hundreds of other companies. It's downloaded more than 8 million times a month on npm.When your target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE) don't support certain features natively, it helps you compile it down to a supported version.In short, developers want to take advantage of the latest syntax in JavaScript before it's implemented in browsers, now. Because the version of JavaScript depends on the client's browser, we can't rely on the fact they are using an up to date browser.Transition to Natively Support JavaScriptBabel abstracts the browser away so that you can worry about writing your application rather than trying to figure out what features are supported in each one.For example: if you support an older browser such as Internet Explorer 9, it won't have any of the features in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), so Babel will transform your code into ES5 which is supported.[1, 2, 3].map(n => n + 2); // arrow functions![1, 2, 3].map(function (a) { // compiled to a regular function expression  return a+2;});Efforts like https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env means you can take advantage of the native browser support when possible.Please read the tips below on how to get started and how to create a successful proposal!",323330,http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SgPfGA3yKtXE8SpqyNFL0dPQlQbXYbawc4QS2A8UvG6pdZvw4zwPECNCkbNVtZ6nXyYIxDDxL_lniJCM2GbrIgQEnLropJk,nan,Babel,2,"Babel, the community driven compiler for writing next generation JavaScript",javascript,babel,nodejs,nan,nan,compilers,ast,minifier,tc39,nan,https://babeljs.io/,2017,nan

The BeeWare Project aims to take the power of Python as a language, and use it to enable users of all skill levels to develop applications with native user interfaces; to do for mobile and desktop user-facing software the same thing that Django has done for web software. This means giving users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices, including:Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,Libraries to access the native capabilities of devices,Tools to help develop, debug, and deploy these projects.Python nativeIf Python isn't available as a first-class option on a platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that.Platform nativeIt's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development. We also distribute our tools and libraries using platform-native distribution channels, such as app stores.More than just codeWe're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. We also aspire to develop a healthy and sustainable community - one that is aware of mental health issues of its participants, and provides the resources for people to start engaging, and continue to engage with the community.",None,http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1rn4mBGgb0b0WyJrcK__M074I7LIUzcOIwRFpLYUbw63ADidvYiNjyNQR-ALTJrXp0dlywT9S3EwkIg6trXFFqaFxwm8RjQ,nan,BeeWare Project,2,Tools for cross-platform Python application development.,python,ios,android,javascript,java,mobile,cross desktop,app development,nan,nan,https://pybee.org,2018,nan

Blender allows the creation of anything you can imagine - for films, games, or any medium you like. In addition to animation tools; Blender has numerous modeling tools (digital sculpting as if you were working with clay; polygon modeling in traditional methods; NURBs, and metaballs); a powerful modifier system that can create complex objects with simple procedures; powerful texturing and painting system with advanced UV unwrapping; a complete simulation system (smoke and water fluids; physics; cloth; softbody; hair) and particle system to create amazing special effects; a built in game engine; powerful rendering; built in video editing, motion tracking, and compositing; complete scripting language and a lot more. The Blender Foundation is an independent organization (a Dutch ""stichting""), acting as a non-profit public benefit corporation, with the following goals: * To establish services for active users and developers of Blender * To maintain and improve the current Blender product via a public accessible source code system under the GNU GPL license * To establish funding or revenue mechanisms that serve the foundation's goals and cover the foundation's expenses * To provide individual artists and small teams with a complete, free and open source 3D creation pipeline.",nan,nan,http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:Ref/GoogleSummerOfCode/2012/Ideas,Blender Foundation,13,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2012,https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2012/orgs/blender/logo-200.png

Starting out as a student, I was guided very proficiently by Michel, Qiaobin, John, and Cody throughout the program. This, in turn, boosted my confidence and improved my communication as well as coding standard. It also gave me in-depth knowledge about the kernel development and using present technologies to build future ideas. Linux XIA gives ample opportunities to improve and take charge in the process. After successfully completing the program the team trusted me to take a more challenging role as a mentor. Their belief motivated me to work harder and deliver more to my mentees.

Have CCExtractor read the stream direct from the TV tuner and it will give you a subtitle file in real time.CCExtractor gets along with users (it has a nice GUI for Windows, Linux, and OSX), scripts (comes with a great command line interface) and other tools (there's a library, too - you can use CCExtractor's engine to create your own tools).CCExtractor is international: It intends to support any language for which video subtitles exists, from English to Korean to Russian.CCExtractor as a program is ever expanding. New subtitle formats come along, new video encoders, and so on.Finally, ccextractor.org, the organization, is the group of developers that makes this possible, along with some key users that provide lots and lots of the strangest samples you could think of.Our goal is to continue expanding functionality and support so CCExtractor is to subtitles what ffmpeg is to video: The only tool you'll ever need.",FFFFFF,http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/g-qHkbu5hP4huRhnbODLKqijUdAYdZ4hs6yKRbqsB297GFW0N_eBNpCtgBYcX-czw1Gb43v8bLXtYE3FPUsJJjHCy6NL1g,nan,CCExtractor Development,6,The de-facto standard tool for everything related to subtitles.,c,video,ffmpeg,subtitles,linux,media analysis,database,subtitles,decoder,video,http://www.ccextractor.org,2016,nan

CCExtractor takes almost any video file that contains subtitles and generates a clean transcript with in-sync timing. While it's obviously a niche application, it's used in a number of scenarios: - Universities such as UCLA use it to organize and index their enormous news archive. -Â The largest media companies use it to convert the closed captioning of their TV shows to internet formats, since it is now mandatory by the FCC that TV shows delivered via streaming must be closed captioned too. - Fan subtitles sites use it to feed their archive. If you've ever downloaded a subtitle file for a TV show most likely it came from CCExtractor. - News clipping companies use it extensively for TV trends analysis. Our organization if focused on improving CCExtractor and keeping it open source. While our tool is conceptually small, it's getting bigger and bigger because it's meant to support all kind of subtitles from every corner of the world. Standards are different in Europe, South America, North America, Asia... and in fact with the migration from analog to digital each zone has at least two. Then you can have them in MP4, MPEG2, etc. Because of the nature of our tool, many other higher level programs use it (such as HandBrake). On the other hand, we took code from MythTV and others. We also integrate (optionally) with ffmpeg. Because of this, we expect lots of cross-project ideas. We'd expect students to have an interest in one or more of these topics: Subtitles, video, compression, networking, multithreading... Â and having an interest is really all it takes.

CERN is one of the worldâ€™s largest and most exciting centers for fundamental physics research. Experiments at CERN have probed the fundamental nature of matter and the forces which affect it. CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web (http://info.cern.ch), invented by Tim Berners-Lee. The SFT group's efforts, like most of CERN's current activities, are directed towards the worldâ€™s highest-energy elementary particle accelerator - the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html) and its experiments. There are four large experiments at the LHC (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb) which seek to expand the frontiers of knowledge and complete our understanding of the constituents of matter and their interactions, of the conditions in the first instants after the Big Bang and of the differences between matter and anti-matter. During 2012, ATLAS and CMS announced the discovery of a new boson, which has been confirmed recently to have the properties of a Higgs boson - similar to the one required by the Standard Model of Particle Physics. NOTE: The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge. Operating the LHC and running each experiment requires a large amount of software. A large part of this software is common and open source. The open source software spans the range from system software to more specialized physics-oriented tools and toolkits. The projects to which students can contribute span several software projects: SixTrack is a simulation tool for the trajectory of high energy particles in accelerators. It has been used in the design and optimization of the LHC and is now being used to design the upgrade that will be installed in the next decade, the High-Luminsity LHC (HL-LHC). Sixtrack has been adapted to take advantage of large scale volunteer computing resources provided by the LHC@Home project. It has been engineered to give the exact same results after millions of operations on several, very different computer platforms. The ROOT Â (http://root.cern.ch/) software framework is used to handle, store and analyze the data of all LHC experiments. The experiments store both their raw data and intermediate, processed results using ROOT, as it offers an open source format and is very compact. Having the data defined as a set of objects, it is possible to get access separately to particular attributes of the selected objects, without touching the remaining attributes. ROOT includes many tools for analysis of data, from histogramming methods in an arbitrary number of dimensions, curve fitting, function evaluation, minimization, graphics and visualization. It includes also a built-in C++ interpreter the command language which is used as a scripting, or macro language. Cling is a new C++11 standard-compliant interpreter, an interpreter built on top of Clang (www.clang.llvm.org) and LLVM (www.llvm.org) compiler infrastructure. Cling is being developed at CERN as a standalone project. It is also being integrated into ROOT, giving access to a C++11 standards compliant interpreter. ROOT is an open system that can be dynamically extended by linking external libraries. This makes ROOT a premier platform on which to build data acquisition, simulation and data analysis systems. The Geant4 toolkit (http://cern.ch/geant4) is a key component of the common physics software. It simulates the interactions of radiation with material in any setup, including the detectors of the LHC or other High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. There are many diverse uses in other fields: assessing the effects of radiation on the electronics of satellites and designing improved medical detectors with specialized applications such as the Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission GATE (http://www.opengatecollaboration.org). LHC experiments use Geant4 to compare the signatures of events from new physics (such as the Higgs boson and particles which are candidates for dark matter) to the signatures of events coming from known interactions which could mimic them. Geant4 is created, developed and maintained by the Geant4 collaboration (http://geant4.org) of over 100 physicists and engineers from around the world from Europe (CERN, IN2P3/France, INFN/Italy), US (Fermilab, SLAC), Japan (KEK), Canada (Triumf), Russia (Lebedev) as well as many universities. A key area of current research are extension to utilize current and emerging computer architectures. One of these efforts is the Geant Vector Prototype project, which aims to demonstrate improved performance on the latest CPU and accelerator hardware. IgProf (https://igprof.org) is a lightweight performance profiling and analysis tool. It can be run in one of three modes: as a performance profiler, as a memory profiler, or in instrumentation mode. When used as a performance profiler it provides statistical sampling based performance profiles of the application. In the memory profiling mode it can be used to obtain information about the total number of dynamic memory allocations, profiles of the ``live'' memory allocations in the heap at any given time and information about memory leaks. The memory profiling is particularly important for C/C++ programs, where large amounts of dynamic memory allocation can affect performance and where very complex memory footprints need to be understood. In nearly all cases no code changes are needed to obtain profiles. The CERN Virtual Machine (CernVM, http://cernvm.cern.ch) is a project to investigate how virtualization technologies can be used to improve and simplify the daily interaction of physicists with experiment software frameworks and the Grid infrastructure.

Catrobat and the software developed by the Catrobat team are inspired by the Scratch programming system developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. Catroid is an Android app that allows to create and execute Catrobat programs on Android phones and tablets. Catroid allows kids and teens from age 8 up to easily create Android apps using only their mobile device, without the need for an additional PC. Catrobat programs are assembled in a graphical â€œLegoâ€ù-type style as known from Scratch (only for PCs) or AppInventor (also needs a PC for develoment and is less oriented towards kids or teens). Paintroid is part of the Catrobat project and is a graphical paint editor for the Android platform that, among others, allows setting parts of pictures to transparent (pinch zoom up to single pixel level), which is an important feature if one wants to extract, e.g., oneâ€™s own head from a photograph while deleting all the background, or some other part from any image, in order to use the resulting shape as a graphical element inside oneâ€™s app. Catroidâ€™s Web 2.0 community site allows kids and teens to share their apps in a way similar to Scratch's community site, including the sharing and remixing of Catrobat programs under the AGPL license, the aim being to facilitate the learning of programming skills among kids and teens (and also older users). Typical users of Catroid would be, e.g. an 11 year old girl wanting to share her Hannah Montana animation with her friends, or a 15 year old boy wanting to implement a multi-player multi-touch space invaders game. Thus, usability is a major aspect of the project and is accorded top priority. The motivation behind the Catrobat project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world. The Catrobat team released a first public beta in March 2012. There are several subprojects involving, e.g., the bidirectional coupling with an AR.Drone quadcopter, with a Lego Mindstorms robot, with a Robocup soccer robot via the Arduino open-source electronics platform, a program that allows to package a Catroid project as an apk file (i.e., as a stand-alone Android app), an HTML5 player (though not supporting all Catroid features as not all sensors etc can be accessed), a localization / internationalization support site (we currently support several languages, with speakers of English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Arabian, German, Turkish, French, Japanese, Urdu, and Malaysian in the team), and the building of an engaging tutorial game inspired by the funny tutorial of Nintendoâ€™s Wario Ware: D.I.Y. programming game for the Nintendo DS. The Catrobat team currently is composed of more than 100 active developers. We use the test-driven development method (test-first style; tests used as declarative executable program documentation) with several additional practices from extreme programming such as ping pong pair programming in frequently changing pairs, kanban system, very clear self-explaining clean code (including test code; no comments in code unless not expressible in the code itself; no prose documentation), continuous usability consideration (paper prototyping on a daily basis, the personas method, usability expert feedbacks, and usability tests with children), continuous integration using git, automated unit-, functional-, regression-, and monkey-testing, permanent refactoring, the YAGNI principle, and collective code ownership. External contributors will need to follow our test-driven development method.

1100,nan,"Mailing List: http://groups.google.com/group/catroid/   Catroid is an on-device visual programming language for Android smartphones and tablets that is inspired by the Scratch programming language for PCs developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. Catroid allows kids and teens from age 8 up to easily write Android apps using only their mobile device, without the need for an additional PC. Catroid projects are written in a graphical â€œLegoâ€ù-type style as known from Scratch or AppInventor.  Paintroid is part of the Catroid project and is a graphical paint editor for the Android platform that, among others, allows setting parts of pictures to transparent (pinch zoom up to single pixel level), which is an important feature if one wants to extract, e.g., oneâ€™s own head from a photograph while deleting all the background, or some other part from any image, in order to use the resulting shape as a graphical element inside oneâ€™s app.  Catroidâ€™s Web 2.0 community site allows kids and teens to share their apps in a way similar to Scratch's community site, including the sharing and remixing of Catroid project files under the AGPL license, the aim being to facilitate the learning of programming skills among kids and teens (and also older users).  Typical users of Catroid would be, e.g. an 11 year old girl wanting to share her Hannah Montana animation with her friends, or a 15 year old boy wanting to implement a multi-player multi-touch space invaders game. Thus, usability is a major aspect of the project and is accorded top priority.  The motivation behind the Catroid project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.  The Catroid team released a first public beta in March 2012. There are several subprojects involving, e.g. the bidirectional coupling with an AR.Drone quadcopter, with a Lego Mindstorms robot, with a Robocup soccer robot via the Arduino open-source electronics platform, a program that allows to package a Catroid project as an apk file (i.e., as a stand-alone Android app), an HTML5 player (though not supporting all Catroid features as not all sensors etc can be accessed), a localization / internationalization support site (we currently support several languages, with speakers of English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Arabian, German, Turkish, French, Japanese, Urdu, and Malaysian in the team), and the building of an engaging tutorial game inspired by the funny tutorial of Nintendoâ€™s Wario Ware: D.I.Y. programming game for the Nintendo DS.  The Catroid team currently is composed of more than 70 active developers. We use the test-driven development method (test-first style; tests used as declarative executable program documentation) with several additional practices from extreme programming such as ping pong pair programming in frequently changing pairs, kanban system, very clear self-explaining clean code (including test code; no comments in code unless not expressible in the code itself; no prose documentation), continuous usability consideration (paper prototyping on a daily basis, the personas method, usability expert feedbacks, and usability tests with children), continuous integration using Mercurial on Google Code, automated unit-, functional-, regression-, and monkey-testing, permanent refactoring, the YAGNI principle, and collective code ownership.

We provide access to state-of-art distributed computer vision algorithms as a cloud service through Web Interface & APIs. Researchers, Students and Developers will be able to access these distributed computer vision algorithms and the computation power through small number of click and minimal lines of code.Â  A recent World Economic Form report and a New York Times article declared data to be a new class of economic asset, like currency or gold. Visual content is arguably the fastest growing data on the web. Photo-sharing websites like Flickr and Facebook now host more than 6 and 90 Billion photos (respectively). Besides consumer data, diverse scientific communities (Civil & Aerospace Engineering, Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, and Astrophysics, etc) are also beginning to generate massive archives of visual content, without necessarily the expertise or tools to analyze them.We are building CloudCV, an ambitious system that will provide access to state-of-the-art distributed computer vision algorithms on the cloud, as a service to the community. CloudCV will contain algorithms for end-to-end processing of image & video content: from low-level filtering and data processing to high-level tasks like face detection, person detection, object detection, tracking, action and intent detection, etc.Challenge. Designing and implementing efficient and provably correct parallel computer vision algorithms is extremely challenging. Some tasks like extracting statistics from image collections are embarrassingly parallel, i.e. can be parallelized simply by distributing the images to different machines. This is where framework such as MapReduce have demonstrated success. Unfortunately, most tasks in computer vision and machine learning such as training a face detector are not embarrassingly parallel â€“ there are data and computational dependencies between images and various steps in the algorithm. Moreover, for each such parallel algorithm, researchers must repeatedly solve the same low-level problems: building & maintaining a cluster of machines, formulating parallelizable components in computer vision algorithms, designing multi-threaded primitives, writing custom hardware wrappers, implementing mechanisms to avoid race-conditions, dead-locks, etc.Current status as of February 2015 (and plans till GTC)â€¢ A distributed implementation of panoramic image stitching is available as a web-service.â€¢ We have released 16 ""industry standard"" pre-computed features for all 1.2 million images in the ImageNet Challenge [7], as a resource that others in the community can build on.â€¢ We have released Python and Matlab APIs that allow users to ""call"" CloudCV functions for image stitching and object detection. In all cases, the images are sent to our servers at Virginia Tech and EC2 instances, and and results of the executables are made available to the users' running Python and Matlab instances when ready.â€¢ A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image auto-tagging web-service.Â Both these demos utilize the Caffe framework, and run on NVIDIA Tesla K40s, courtesy of the NVIDIA Academic Hardware Donation Program (NVIDIA contact: Stephen Jones). â€¢ Â Training a new category apart from 1000 categories that are already present in the model.

34,Social / Communications,"After four years of development the Android Jabber/XMPP client is mostly feature complete for now. However an instant messaging client in a federated ecosystem like Jabber is only as good as the rest of the ecosystem. The ecosystem needs good desktop clients, it needs good servers and good providers who maintain their servers and keep them up to date with the latest features. Conversations.im as an umbrella organization is about bringing improvements to that ecosystem. Partially by improving existing clients and servers but also by creating tools that aid server administrators to maintain their servers and that aid end users to pick a good, stable provider. Those tools include the XMPP Compliance Tester or the XMPP uptime monitor. We have a collection of ideas that we think will improve the end user experience, but we are also very open to hearing other ideas that we didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think of ourself. Have you always thought about creating a service that will look up phone numbers and return Jabber IDs or otherwise improve the discoverable of contacts? Great. Let us hear your ideas and we might be able to find a suitable mentor for you. Want to add a new feature to an existing client? Great we will put you in touch with the appropriate mentors.

We make use of bleeding-edge protocol extensions where available, but more than that, we are also actively developing novel approaches to yet unsolved problems. We are not afraid to try new things and our active community is always willing to try out prototype implementations. Furthermore, members of the Conversations team are also part of the XMPP Standards Foundation to standardize newly developed approaches for modern, mobile friendly XMPP.One very successful example of such innovation is OMEMO encryption, which is now supported by 5+ popular XMPP clients and was originally developed for Conversations as a GSoC project.Over time, the Conversations project also developed various tools to make life easier for end users and also make the XMPP world more approachable for new comers.

Their extraction is impossible which makes the Crypto Stick immune to computer viruses and Trojan horses. The user-chosen PIN and the tamper-proof design protect in case of loss and theft. The complete software stack is Open Source to allow verifying the security and integration with own applications. Different PCB/boards on the market can be used for development. Many exciting features are already implemented such as support of Google's two-factor authentication, SSH, GnuPG, Mozilla Thunderbird, OpenSC.

36,Data and Databases,"The DBpedia project is aiming to extract structured content from the information created in various Wikimedia projects. This structured information resembles an open knowledge graph (KG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A knowledge graph is a special kind of database which stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. Google uses a similar approach to create those knowledge cards during search.DBpedia currently describes 38.3 million â€œthingsâ€ù of 685 different â€œtypesâ€ù in 125 languages, with over 3 billion â€œfactsâ€ù (September 2014). It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata, New York Times, CIA World Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday.DBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL).

37,Operating Systems,"The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause to create a free operating system.Debian GNU/Linux is:Full featured: Users can select which packages to install; Debian provides a tool for this purpose. You can find a list and descriptions of the packages currently available in Debian at any of the Debian mirror sites.Free to use and redistribute: There is no consortium membership or payment required to participate in its distribution and development. All packages that are formally part of Debian GNU/Linux are free to redistribute, usually under terms specified by the GNU General Public License.The Debian FTP archives also carry approximately 696 software packages (in the non-free and contrib sections), which are distributable under specific terms included with each package.Dynamic: With about 1033 volunteers constantly contributing new and improved code, Debian is evolving rapidly. The FTP archives are updated twice every day.Although Debian GNU/Linux itself is free software, it is a base upon which value-added Linux distributions can be built. By providing a reliable, full-featured base system, Debian provides Linux users with increased compatibility, and allows creators to eliminate duplication of effort and focus on the things that make their distribution special.A large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd.

The Programming Languages Laboratory (LAMP) is led by Professor Martin Odersky. Odersky, an ACM Fellow, is considered one of the world's top experts in programming languages design. He is the co-designer of the Java Generics proposal and is the one of the original authors of the current javac compiler. Aside from Prof. Odersky, LAMP comprises 7 graduate students and 5 post-doctoral researchers/programmers. We are best known for the development of the Scala programming language (http://www.scala-lang.org), which is generating ever-increasing interest from industry and research communities alike. Currently, Scala is extensively used in prominent companies, including Twitter, Xerox, Sony, LinkedIn, EDFT, Siemens, and Reaktor. Additionally, we have close ties with external Scala-related projects, such as the Eclipse Scala plugin (www.scala-ide.org), Lift (http://liftweb.net/), Akka (http://www.scala-lang.org/node/4791), Kestrel (http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1008), and ScalaTest (http://node/3869). Scala runs on the JVM and .NET, integrating near-seamlessly with libraries on those platforms. This signficantly reduces barriers to adoption and has been a key factor in Scalaâ€™s success. Worldwide, there are an estimated 100,000 skilled Scala programmers--a number that is continually increasing. Last yearâ€™s Scala Days conference (http://days2010.scala-lang.org/) garnered significant interest within the community--so much so that we reached capacity long before the registration deadline.

257,Programming Languages and Development Tools,"Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It competes with projects like React as a tool for creating websites and web apps. Elm has a very strong emphasis on simplicity, ease-of-use, and quality tooling.The overall goal is to combine:A devotion to communication, design, and user experience.Strong theoretical foundations.Examples of these goals in practice include the following.No Runtime ExceptionsUnlike hand-written JavaScript, Elm code does not produce runtime exceptions in practice. Instead, Elm uses type inference to detect problems during compilation and give friendly hints. This way problems never make it to your users. NoRedInk has 90k+ lines of Elm, and after more than a year in production, it still has not produced a single runtime exception.Great PerformanceElm has its own virtual DOM implementation, designed for simplicity and speed. All values are immutable in Elm, and the benchmarks show that this helps us generate particularly fast JavaScript code.Enforced Semantic VersioningElm can detect all API changes automatically thanks to its type system. We use that information to force everything in our package catalog to follow semantic versioning precisely.

EDGI is committed to tracking changes to US federal environmental management and governance, in a range of agencies including EPA, NOAA, NASA, USGS, OSHA, DoE and BLM, among many others.EDGI brings together North American social scientists, environmental and physical scientists, lawyers, and other information and environmental professionals to document and advocate for the vital importance of evidence-based environmental policy. Through three core working groups EDGI analyzes changes to federal agencies' 1) funding and regulation, 2) personnel and research and 3) public data.Through the third working group, EDGI has been a leading partner in the international effort to preserve and track federal environmental data, and support environmental scientists, non-profit organizations, and foundations by making this data publicly available. We are also indexing millions of government web pages on a weekly basis, tracking changes to them, and producing regular reports. With data collection efforts well underway and supported by many hundreds of volunteers at events across North America, our focus now turns to building first-rate tools to support our work. We need deep thinkers to develop protocols for the resilient, sustainable, accessible, distributed data storage networks of the future; machine learning experts to sift through millions of web pages to find the most important changes; and security specialists to protect the privacy of our volunteers and ensure the integrity of our data.

Free UK Genealogy provides free access to historical data of interest to family historians and others. Over twenty years, thousands of volunteers have so far transcribed over 400 million records. The databases, search engines and user interfaces have largely largely designed and maintained by volunteers, who have been supported by a number of contractors and, more recently, a small team of support staff.  FreeREG uses mongodb, Ruby on Rails, and Refinery CMS.  FreeCEN is transitioning from mysql to mongodb, from php to Ruby on Rails, and does not have a CMS in its old interface (www.freecen.org.uk).For FreeREG, we are planning to use the summer to finish work on Version 1.5 Coordinator Enhancement - these are features which allow our volunteer coordinators to support the transcribers in their teams, and to monitor and maintain the quality of the transcription work.  We hope to have finished the tasks relating to the development of new communications systems (but there may be some bug fixing to do) and be working on improvements suggested by the coordinators.For FreeCEN, we are also  planning to use the summer to work on features for Coordinators - but this is at an earlier level.

Our goal is to do so through the implementation of an immersive world with distinctive dialog and graphical styles in a format that is friendly to all ages while providing a fair amount of choice to the player. In view of this, we rely on high quality literary content to provide entertainment and emotional investment as well as educational benefits. FreedroidRPG is an open source sci-fi isometric role playing game. It strives at providing an immersive ambience backed by refined graphics and music tracks. Besides the hack'n'slash action phases, dialogs with dozens of characters take care of storytelling. The player can fight with melee or ranged weapons, take control of his enemies by hacking, and remotely execute code on enemy robots. We have a storyline strong enough to be appealing to people who are more after roleplaying than hack'n'slash. The development team is currently made of around six people - four coders, and two people taking care of game content, and we get many contributions from other people, for a total of about 10 people active at a given time. Those contributions notably include music tracks, levels, and graphics. All of us are volunteers.

Freenet is decentralised to make it less vulnerable to attack, and if used in ""darknet"" mode, where users only connect to their friends, is very difficult to detect. Communications by Freenet nodes are encrypted and are routed through other nodes to make it extremely difficult to determine who is requesting the information and what its content is. Users contribute to the network by giving bandwidth and a portion of their hard drive (called the ""data store"") for storing files. Files are automatically kept or deleted depending on how popular they are, with the least popular being discarded to make way for newer or more popular content. Files are encrypted, so generally the user cannot easily discover what is in his datastore, and hopefully can't be held accountable for it. Chat forums, websites, and search functionality, are all built on top of this distributed data store. Freenet has been downloaded over 2 million times since the project started, and used for the distribution of censored information all over the world including countries such as China and the Middle East. Ideas and concepts pioneered in Freenet have had a significant impact in the academic world. Our 2000 paper ""Freenet: A Distributed Anonymous Information Storage and Retrieval System"" was the most cited computer science paper of 2000 according to Citeseer, and Freenet has also inspired papers in the worlds of law and philosophy. Ian Clarke, Freenet's creator and project coordinator, was selected as one of the top 100 innovators of 2003 by MIT's Technology Review magazine. An important recent development, which very few other networks have, is the ""darknet"": By only connecting to people they trust, users can greatly reduce their vulnerability, and yet still connect to a global network through their friends' friends' friends and so on. This enables people to use Freenet even in places where Freenet may be illegal, makes it very difficult for governments to block it, and does not rely on tunneling to the ""free world"".

Some of our friends in the community who prefer to keep a ""lower profile"" are helping people to communicate in difficult environments in Iran and Syria. And other exciting things are happening. Software, networks, content - it is not enough. We are working on Open Hardware, re-programming chips and testing the limits of software and hardware. The idea of a self-recharging router has been around for a while and we are now building a truly low cost solar router putting the complete schematics online. Others are working on extremely low cost self-deploying wifi phone networks. We are exploring GSM technologies, setting up Open Source GSM mobile phone networks at festivals offering free communications with your personal mobile phone.

Besides that the initiative supports communities developing know-how to set up their own networks. Freifunk is applying as an umbrella organization for Google Summer of Code. The freifunk community is acting as an entry point to a network of projects developing tools for mesh networks including the Freifunk Firmware and OpenWrt projects, routing protocols such as OLSR and B.A.T.M.A.N., tools like Maps for networks (e.g. freimap), scanning tools like the horst tool and many more. Recently people also started to develop Open Hardware like the Mesh Potato for villagetelco. With the freifunk firmware it is relatively easy to bring up new wireless mesh networks using ad-hoc WLAN communication layer 2 and layer 3 routing with OLSR, BATMAN and other protocols. Originated in Germany, Freifunk has been deployed successfully in many countries. The OLPC project in Afghanistan uses freifunk for its mesh deployments to distribute digital books, news and educational media. In Ghana freifunk is used to bridge the digital divide in villages. In Vietnam freifunk is used to offer Internet connections at Free and Open Source events like FOSSASIA. In Europe and the Americas city and village networks lower costs for communities and small and medium sized companies, that share common Internet connections, ADSL, Telephone or Satellite uplinks in remote regions. The Freifunk Firmware is a modified version of OpenWrt Linux Version that is developed for router devices. The main aim of the firmware is to make it easier and faster to set up wireless mesh networks. Designed as an embedded Linux for low powered network devices the system can be adapted for a wide variety of devices. Freifunk/OpenWrt supports ad-hoc WLAN communication and layer 2 and 3 routing. Open Source routing protocols can be installed via package updates. Most common protocols are the OLSR protocol and the BATMAN routing protocol. By building the Freifunk embedded firmware together with the OpenWrt team the community is developing an easy to use self-configuring, self-fixing and self-tuning mesh networkÂ  (http://wiki.openwrt.org/Freifunk). The Freifunk firmware allows anyone to relatively easily build mesh networks of routers.Â  Such networks can be surprisingly scalable involving hundreds / thousands of nodes and made using normal off the shelf routers. Current test version on SVN (https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/GetSource) are enabling developers to create plugins for the firmware. These plugins will enable users to offer locations based services, local search, router CMS, local fm radio distribution via routers, and many more. An example for locations based services is Apple Bonjour that offers users to share their music in local wifi networks, however, in Freifunk mesh networks, there are many more ways to share and communicate as services are build on open standards and open source software. Another project where we are connecting services is the Villagetelco project, where we adapt the firmware to offer telephone services over an adhoc network (www.villagetelco.org). Going in another direction the community also engages to port applications and desktop environments such as LXDE to OpenWrt for Freifunk clouds to offer faster devices with an X interface and making use of thousands of available applications.

1617,nan,"Mailing List: http://freifunk.net/mailman/listinfo/wlanware   [IMAGE http://wiki.freifunk.net/images/7/70/Logo_ffn_170x165.gif] The Freifunk movement develops software for free local wireless infrastructures like mesh networks to share local services and Internet connections. Freifunk Linux Firmwares based on OpenWrt are running on thousands of routers worldwide. Commercially adapted versions are used in hundred of thousands of devices. It is the goal of Freifunk to make it easy to set up local wireless networks with local services. Freifunk meaning free wireless is the pendant to free and open source software or freely licensed content. The tools used in Freifunk networks are exclusively open source. Open source mesh networks are more cost efficient and offer new usage cases (local content sharing, local fm radio networks, sensor networks, distant visual observation etc.) and business opportunities. Freifunk is comparable to an open digital space like public streets and parks. Freifunk software tools and firmwares are available in different Â¨flavoursÂ¨ adapted to local conditions and policies of communities and local ISPs (for example a business man in a small town, who sets up a mesh network for his community and gets paid for providing Internet, whereas local exchange inside the network is freely available). The Freifunk community encompasses people working on open source software, open hardware, the actual set up of infrastructures and freely licensed content. -- FREIFUNK SUMMER OF CODE -- Freifunk is participating in the Google Summer of Code as an umbrella organisation bringing together different projects in the free network community. We are encouraging students to apply with any project related to open wireless infrastructures and specifically mesh networks. What do we need to establish a mesh network? What makes it easier to set up and administer a local network? What is a missing feature or application? What else do we need to set up mesh networks in regions in Asia and Africa where the Internet is not yet available? Ask yourself these question and please talk us about your ideas. -- SUMMER OF CODE AND FREIFUNK COOPERATION WITH UNIVERSITIES -- The Freifunk community has established relations to universities and educational institutions. We are able to offer ECTS credits for many projects in the summer of code through the TU Berlin (see Ideas Page for details http://wiki.freifunk.net/Ideas). Please check with your university for specific conditions for acceptance of credits. -- FREIFUNK FIRMWARES-- The embedded Freifunk Firmwares (operating system) are specially adapted OpenWrt Linux Versions that are developed for routers and mobile devices. The firmwares are particularly lightweight and use less resources compared to other systems. They run on devices with minimal hardware specifications and work well on extremely low powered devices thus can be used in environments with limited energy resources. Main features of Freifunk Firmwares are a common web interface and pre-installed mesh routing protocols. There are different versions available that are customized versions of Freifunk OpenWrt developed by local groups and adapted to local needs and conditions. For example a large city network has different needs than a small Freifunk network in a mountainous village. The firmwares offer common features and can be extended through plugins. The original Freifunk Firmware is developed by Sven-Ola since 2003. Many others have joined since then. The main aim of the firmwares is to make it easier and faster to set up wireless networks, and particularly mesh networks. Installation, customization and administration of OpenWRT for normal users is much easier with Freifunk Firmwares as it provides a prebuild Linux version with OLSR daemon and a web based user interface. -- LOW POWERED DEVICES -- Freifunk Firmwares are designed as embedded LinuxÂ´ for low powered devices and tools. The firmwares can be adapted for a wide variety of local as well as mobile devices. -- A STRONG COMMUNITY AND MANY COMMERCIAL USERS -- The Freifunk firmwares are being used in wireless mesh networks around the world with the biggest ones reaching more than 700 nodes in cities like Berlin or Leipzig. Commercially adapted versions are included on hundreds of thousands of routers of companies like FON.com (main investor Google) and Open-Mesh.com. The firmware is currently gaining popularity with local ISPs in developing countries such as China, India and South Africa, as it is easily adaptable to local needs. Teams of our community are also working on combining advantages of projects like Android and OpenWrt by sharing code. -- WLAN/Wifi COMMUNICATION -- Freifunk/OpenWrt supports ad-hoc WLAN communication and layer 2 and 3 routing with the OLSR protocol and the BATMAN routing protocol. By building the Freifunk embedded firmware together with the OpenWrt team we are developing an easy to use self-configuring, self-fixing and self-tuning mesh network (http://wiki.openwrt.org/Freifunk). -- PLUGINS -- Current test versions on SVN (https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/GetSource) are enabling developers to create plugins for the firmware. These plugins will enable users to offer locations based services, local search, router CMS, local fm radio distribution via routers, and many more. An example for locations based services is Apple Bonjour that offers users to share their music in local wifi networks, however, in Freifunk mesh networks, there are many more ways to share and communicate as services are build on open standards and open source software. -- LOCAL SERVICES -- WLAN Telephones for local and regional phone companies - this is another project where we are connecting services for more cost efficient communication: The Villagetelco project. The goal is to adapt the firmware to offer telephone services over an adhoc network (www.villagetelco.org). -- ADAPTING THE FIRMWARES -- Going in another direction the community also engages to port applications and desktop environments such as LXDE (http://lxde.org) to OpenWrt for Freifunk clouds to offer faster devices with an X interface and making use of thousands of available applications. The porting of code from Google Android also aims to support the adaptability of the Firmware for special use cases. -- COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD -- The development of the Freifunk Firmwares is supported by the freifunk.net initiative. Freifunk.net also supports the set up of networks and educates the public and politicians about open standards and free frequencies.

Funf aims to lower the barrier of entry for tapping into the different signals available for mobile phones. The project is aimed at developers, researchers, and end users, and as such has three levels of offerings: (1) The Funf SDK for Android (2) The Funf-in-a-Box service where users can go to a site where they configure a custom data collection app in less than five minutes, with zero programming, which is then compiled for them. (3) Funf Journal a mobile app that is available on the Android Play Store, and allows users to collect and explore data about their lives (quantified-self), as well as allows developers/researchers to evaluate the capabilities underneath the hood. The project had won several awards, including theÂ 2012 SXSW Accelerator competition, theÂ Knight Foundationâ€™s 2012 News Challenge on Networks, and two Google Research Awards Â Â  Â  Q: Where is your project idea list? A: It is linked right below this section, but just in case here it is again.  Q: â€œI have an idea for a great app that could be built on top of Funf, can that be my project?â€ù A: The main idea of GSoC is to help build out components and capabilities for Funf that  other developers could use as they use the framework. Except for very rare cases, most apps wonâ€™t fit this goal.Â  Q: I donâ€™t know how to program, but would love to learn through GSoC, can I apply? A: Unfortunately teaching you how to program is not the purpose of Google Summer of Code. The goal is to give students who know how to program and are passionate about an open source project the chance to contribute to it and gain industry experience. We expect people to have programming experience and some level of understanding software architecture and Â and the ability to work independently  Q: I just looked at the list of projects and its much shorter than last week! What happened? A: Based on comments and questions received from applicants, we decided to re-organize and clarify the project list so that its focused on the things that are the most useful for the Funf community. Â Some projects have been cut, and others have been clarified with improved descriptions to help applicants focus on what matters the most.",nan,nan,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oZAipiVZlxyYOVIThKY6jT03z41uLR-LMV_9_FIH3RI,Funf.org,2,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2013,https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2013/orgs/funf/logo-200.png

273,Science and Medicine,"GNSS-SDR is an open source Global Navigation Satellite Systems software receiver, written in C++, that is able to work either from raw signal samples stored in a file, or in real-time with a radio-frequency front-end as signal source, and performs all the signal processing until the observable computation and Position-Velocity-Time solution. Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.The proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques.

It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.In brief, a software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware. The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!You can use GNU Radio to write applications to receive and transmit data with radio hardware, or to create entirely simulation-based applications. GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronisation elements, equalizers, demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other types of blocks which are typically found in signal processing systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.GNU Radio applications can be written in either C++ or Python programming language, while the performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point extensions where available.

Due to its lightweight, easy to manage agent, Ganglia is now used in many educational institutions, corporations, research organizations and ISPs.  Many IT professionals come across it in their job every time they have a scalability problem with an application.  Students can probably find it on your own campus, just look for /etc/gmond.conf on UNIX machines to find clues about where the metrics are sent.  Many institutions expose their Ganglia web reports publicly, they can be easily found with a Google query Performance monitoring offers an excellent opportunity for students to develop core skills in many areas including networking, operating systems and also more advanced areas like data science, machine learning, statistics and prediction. The lightweight Ganglia agent, gmond, is written in C and runs on every machine being monitored.  The agent can be extended with plugins written in C or Python to extract metrics from the machine or applications being monitored.  Application monitoring can also be achieved for Java (using JMXetric with Tomcat, JBoss, Spring, etc). The Ganglia data collection and storage process, Gmetad, is also written in C.  It uses the legendary RRDtool for storing the time series data. The Ganglia web reporting system is built with PHP, JavaScript and jQuery.  It does not have any database dependency.  It constructs RRDtool queries/command lines to graph the data. Various integration solutions exist, such as ganglia-nagios-bridge which is developed in Python.  This allows the metrics discovered by Ganglia to be used for alerting in Nagios. Ganglia is a BSD-licensed open-source project that grew out of the University of California, Berkeley Millennium Project which was initially funded in large part by the National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (NPACI) and National Science Foundation RI Award EIA-9802069 For some tips about making an application, please see this blog from Ganglia developer Daniel Pocock",nan,nan,https://github.com/ganglia/monitor-core/wiki/GSoC-2014-project-ideas,Ganglia,4,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2014,https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014/orgs/ganglia/logo-200.png

Designed to make data navigation and manipulation easy, it covers the entire process from data importing to aesthetics refinements and interaction. Users interact with the visualization and manipulate structures, shapes and colors to reveal hidden properties. The goal is to help data analysts to make hypotheses and intuitively discover patterns or errors in large data collections. Gephi is built with Java SE 6 on top of the NetBeans Platform, and uses a large number of Java libraries, including JOGL for its 3-D rendering engine. The strength of Gephi is its usability, performance, and modularity. Modules are loosely coupled, and extensible with plug-ins. Data-centered companies such as LinkedIn, Xerox, Elsevier, and many academics like the Indiana University or the library of Stanford University have already used Gephi for visualizing their data.

The aim of the project is to provide various tools for electric vehicles. There are two sides to the project:For DriversOn one side, we want to provide drivers of electric vehicles with practical solutions, that is, with optimal driving direction for their route. For that we are developing a platform independent navigation system.For ScientistsOn the other side, we want to develop tools for scientifically analyzing algorithmic solutions. For that we are developing tools for visualization of algorithms, for comparing their performance, we want to provide a generic API for custom algorithms and a lot more.IdeasInstead of working towards a specific electric vehicel, we want to leverage machine learning to derive the parameters automatically, getting better with every route.",ffffff,http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DcEeK4T4tzqj9U6hsm4k-Bsd9H5mrDPo7VOZ4zAXRVQN0I6LwXfkyMEMbADgjTcmW57pEk3rkVzHjDcWlJuMu6RBRS8fSp4,nan,Green Navigation,5,Energy efficient routing for electric vehicles,javascript,java,react,apache spark,tensorflow,routing,eletric mobility,web,machine learning,nan,http://greennav.io,2017,nan

634,nan,"Mailing List: http://hpccsystems.com/mailman/listinfo/hpcc-dev   Reed Elsevier is a world leading provider of information solutions for professionals. Reed Elsevier is a global organisation operating in 24 countries and is also listed on several of the worldâ€™s major stock exchanges as well being a FTSE 100 and FT Global 500 company. We operate across several professional market segments including Scientific, Technical and Medical, Legal and Exhibitions. We also operate in the Risk Solutions and Business Information sector and LexisNexis Risk Solutions is a leading provider of solutions that combine proprietary, public and 3rd party information with advanced technology and analytics. We produce an open source platform to solve â€˜Big Dataâ€™ problems called HPCC SystemsÂ® (High Performance Computing Cluster) which can process, analyse and find links and associations in high volumes of complex data at high speed and with incredible accuracy. HPCC SystemsÂ® has been around for more than a decade, making it the most proven solution of its kind in existence. It is a battle-tested platform for manipulating, transforming, querying and data warehousing Big Data. The data refinery and delivery clusters (Thor and Roxie, respectively) do not need specialised hardware to run, and are usually configured identically. Thor is the data refinery cluster which consumes vast quantities of data. Here the data is transformed, linked and indexed (ETL). Itâ€™s a distributed file system with parallel processing power spread across the nodes. Thor clusters can scale from a single node to thousands. Roxie is the query cluster which provides separate high-performance online query processing and data warehousing. It is optimised for concurrent query processing and like Thor, it also scales from a single node to thousands. We have created our own programming language to run on these clusters called, ECL (Enterprise Control Language). It is a powerful programming language, ideally suited for the manipulation of Big Data for many reasons. It is a transparent and implicitly parallel language which is non-procedural and dataflow oriented. Its syntax is also modular, reusable and extensible. It combines data representation and algorithm implementation and is easily extended using C++ libraries. In fact, it is compiled into optimized C++. As well as the clusters, an HPCC System incorporates common middleware components, and external communications layer, client interfaces for end user services and system management and auxiliary components to support monitoring, facilitate loading and storing of filesystem data from external sources. We have our own development environment for developing code (ECL IDE) and the interface we provide for the monitoring and management of HPCC SystemsÂ® environments is called ECL Watch. LexisNexisÂ® (a division of Reed Elsevier) consolidated its content management, document enhancement and mining systems onto HPCC SystemsÂ®. In doing this, they discovered that the elapsed time taken to perform an enrichment pass of the entire data collection dropped from 6/8 weeks to less than 1 day. This is such a significant change that it means they can increase the degree of enrichment into capabilities that were previously out of reach. Also within Reed Elsevier, HPCC SystemsÂ® has enhanced SciVal which is an analytical solution used by research institutions to get access to facts which support decision making. SciVal users can now customize their own visualizations generated in just a few seconds from the almost 40 terabytes of data underpinning the tool. Since HPCC SystemsÂ® can both crunch huge, predefined requests offline as well as smaller calculations in real time on customer generated data slices, users of SciVal can get structured information immediately upon implementation as well as having the flexibility to tailor-make their own view of the data. Itâ€™s not just within Reed Elsevier that we hear of success stories about HPCC SystemsÂ®. Sandia National Laboratories discovered that HPCC Systems met the challenge of sorting through petabytes of data to find correlations and helped them to generate hypotheses. The Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) of a northeastern US state used HPCC SystemsÂ® to help pinpoint fraud, waste and abuse of the system. HPCC SystemsÂ® enabled them to identify the hidden relationships between million-dollar condo dwellers and their assets, providers, medical facilities or others providing care to the stateâ€™s Medicaid recipients. They were able to sort, link, join and analyse 50 terabytes of public data to find evidence of fraud committed by a group of state Medicaid recipients who were all living in the same high end condominium complex. Other customers include organizations such as government agencies, businesses, non-profits, academic institutions and consulting firms such as Comrise, Cognizant, Infosys and others. Case studies can be found here: http://hpccsystems.com/why-HPCC/case-studies. Our technology has also been used as a resource to help find missing children. LexisNexisÂ® has partnered with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) to develop the ADAMSM Program (Automated Delivery of Alerts on Missing children) which uses technology to distribute missing child posters to police, news media, schools, businesses, medical centers and other recipients within a specific geographic search area. To date, 142 children have been reunited with their families as a result of the ADAMSM Program. Working on the HPCC SystemsÂ® project means that you get to contribute to success stories like these. Our developers are passionate about what they do and seek to improve the system so that we can provide a better service to all our customers.

1145,nan,"Mailing List: https://mail.gna.org/listinfo/hedgewars-dev   Hedgewars is a turn based strategy, artillery, action and comedy game, featuring ""the antics of pink hedgehogs with attitude"" as they battle from the pits of hell to the depths of space. Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the ""Rope"" or ""Parachute"", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. Hedgewars features a variety of different programming languages: with portability in mind: QT and SDL, two of the most used crossplatform are the only dependencies. The main interface is written in C++ and QT and is used for configuring your team and the game option as well as for starting the game. The engine is written in Freepascal, a very compatible Pascal variant, with SDL used for handling the GL context. The server for local LAN and multiplayer is written in Haskell, a very popular functional language. Then each mobile port has its own frontend written in the device native language (ObjC on iOS and Java on Android). An optional dependency is Lua that allows users to write their own missions and game modes, so that the Hedgewars community can get more and more involved in the gameplay development. As said, portability is an important asset for Hedgewars as this game is available for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X on x86, x86_64, PowerPC and ARM, and we are always looking forward to new ports.

1322,nan,"Mailing List:    Access our repository here: http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code-2011-hedgewars/ Hedgewars is a turn based strategy, artillery, action and comedy game, featuring the antics of pink hedgehogs with attitude as they battle from the pits of hell to the depths of space. Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the ""Rope"" or ""Parachute"", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. Hedgewars features a variety of different programming languages: with portability in mind: QT and SDL, two of the most used crossplatform are the only dependencies. The main interface is written in C++ and QT and is used for configuring your team and the game option as well as for starting the game. The engine is written in Freepascal, a very compatible Pascal variant, with SDL used for handling the GL context. The server for local LAN and multiplayer is written in Haskell, a very popular imperative language. An optional dependency is Lua that allows users to write their own missions and game modes, so that the Hedgewars community can get more and more involved in the gameplay development. As said, portability is an important asset for Hedgewars as this game is available for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X on x86, x86_64, PowerPC and ARM, and we are always looking forward to new ports.

74,Science and Medicine,"Description of the codeSOFA is an open-source framework for multi-physics simulation and is being developed for more than 10 years. Today, SOFA benefits from a large international community made up of research centers and companies. The SOFA core has a LGPL license (permissive and non-contaminating) fostering development of prototypes and products under any commercial license. Among the fields of application, SOFA is commonly used for:soft and rigid body dynamics,heat transfer,roboticsand visualization.1. Coupling SOFA + PulseThe objective of this project is to create an open-source plugin for SOFA building an interface with the open-source library Pulse platform. This engine provides comprehensive models for the human physiology. Both API are very close to each other: C++, Cmake, a core library with optional plugins. The integration will be helped with two mentors: one from the SOFA community and another one from the Pulse community.This project will therefore bring a new open-source technology to drive medical research, and innovation.2. Emscriptening SofaWe now would like to be able to execute SOFA in the browser to promote the development of simulation based web-based applications. As SOFA a implemented in C++ this is not straightforward. This project aims at adapting the core of the SOFA simulation framework so that it can be compiled with Emscripten. Emscripten is a compiler that takes C/C++ code and compiles it to efficient subsets of JavaScript as asm.js and webassembly.3. Communication protocols in SOFAThe purpose of this project is to improve the communication plugin by adding more protocols in it such as vrpn, serial bus communication, and also improve the way it works. This plugin has an abstract base to run and implement different protocols asynchronously to the main sofa-framework thread. In a near future it has to be the default base for communicating with SOFA.ContactHugo Talbot, coordinator for SOFA at the Inria Foundation",None,http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WNKjpoMWeQuBHnHS8Yi3sORVKFSRGg4OlTtL7cUX4lXsFJkACbH82ZF0L9jHVvkFYG3n3JXk3mvPtbhEuJIEo8JpDgeUaSoX,nan,Inria Foundation,2,SOFA is an efficient simulation engine for research in medical simulation.,c/c++,qt,webassembly,asm,communication protocol,medical simulation,medical research,physics,real-time,scientific computing,https://www.sofa-framework.org/,2018,nan

77,Science and Medicine,"What is InterMine?InterMine integrates data from different biological sources, providing a web-based user interface for querying and analysing the data. Users can automatically generate code to run queries using our client libraries in R, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Javascript.What technologies do we use?InterMine core is built in Java, and all data are stored in PostgreSQL. We have a legacy JSP-based user interface, with a Clojurescript user interface in early beta. We're also keen on browser-based datavis tools that use of our API, so you'll see a lot of Javascript (or languages that compile to Javascript, like Clojurescript and Coffeescript). Our client libraries provide opportunities to write code in several other languages.What sort of data does InterMine have?Since InterMine is open source, many research organisations around the world run InterMines with their own data, ranging from mice and fruit flies to a broad range of plants. Visit the InterMine Registry to see them all. (The registry was written by a GSoC student last year!) Most InterMines also have a ""data sources"" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates.What kind of problems does InterMine solve?Genomic data is often messy, and there is a lot of it. Scientists use different terms to mean the same thing, and even assign the same gene different names! How can we handle this ambiguity? How can we help the end user make sense of data that is so diverse and complex? One way to help scientists analyse data is to provide visualisations, so weâ€™re always excited to add and adapt different ways to display our data. How do you visualise the features inside a protein, or the interactions between two sets of genes? Code you write for InterMine can have a large impact - since there are dozens of different InterMines, you can often write code to work with one InterMine and with little or no effort, port it to another InterMine with different data.",ffffff,http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Sq0fc5iIoxtpDIqlvRNLY3vtfPKAM-KWobdZl4I60P4K-dOMldXEijOP7sA40Vkm2Og9YfG1vPyVdYds6nzI0t0aVFm11jGK,nan,InterMine,6,"Integrating biological data sources, making it easy to query and analyse data",postgresql,java,javascript,python,clojure,biology,genomics,data science,open science,bioinformatics,http://intermine.org/,2018,nan

Over the years, the ISC team has written over 60 RFCs; we are proud of our substantial contributions to the Internet Engineering Task Force.Administrators adopting Kea are looking for new ways to manage their core network services. They are attracted by Kea's separation of lease data from network communications, that facilitates centralized provisioning. They want to leverage Kea's hooks api and REST api to integrate DHCP with other network operations. As the explosion of containerized applications is breaking the old 1:1 relationship of IP addresses to machines, they need more flexibility and automation for services like DNS updating. The Kea team are looking for contributors who want to help us bring this core network management service into the 21st century by improving and extending the monitoring, provisioning, extensibility and performance.ISC is a non-profit company.

Each component may run in different computers and they are connected using ICE communication middleware. Components may be written in C++, python, Java... and all of them interoperate through explicit ICE interfaces. JdeRobot simplifies the access to hardware devices from the control program. Getting sensor measurements is as simple as calling a local function, and ordering motor commands as easy as calling another local function. The platform attaches those calls to the remote invocation on the components connected to the sensor or the actuator devices. They can be connected to real sensors and actuators or simulated ones, both locally or remotely using the network. Those functions build the API for the Hardware Abstraction Layer. The robotic application get the sensor readings and order the actuator commands using it to unfold its behavior. Several driver components have been developed to support different physical sensors, actuators and simulators. The drivers are used as components installed at will depending on your configuration. They are included in the official release. Currently supported robots and devices: JdeRobot includes several robot programming tools and libraries.

Kiwix runs on most platforms (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and Linux) and is, of course, free to use.The software passed the million direct downloads mark at the end of 2016, 80% of these users being in the Global South. Kiwix is also used by a host of organizations around the world, be it in rural schools of Western and Southern Africa or education and rehabilitation programs in US and European prisons. There are also uses we hadn't planned for: Kiwix is for instance distributed by the Cuban government to help people save on data costs, or by NGOs in North Korea trying to smuggle uncensored information into the hermit kingdom.We have recently started releasing ""custom apps""; that is, Android apps that are based on the Kiwix engine but offer only a specific piece of content.

91,End User Applications,"LEAP is a dedicated to giving all internet users access to secure communication. Our focus is on adapting encryption technology to make it easy to use and widely available. We want to make it possible for any service provider to easily deploy secure services, and for people to use these services without needing to learn new software or change their behavior. These services are based on open, federated standards, but done right: the provider does not have access to the userâ€™s data, and we use open protocols in the most secure way possible.On the server side we have created the LEAP Platform, a â€œprovider in a boxâ€ù set of complementary packages and server recipes automated to lower the barriers of entry for aspiring secure service providers. On the client side, we have created a cross-platform application called Bitmask that automatically configures itself once a user has selected a provider and which services to enable. Bitmask provides a local proxy that a standard email client can connect to, and allows for easy one-click Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.The LEAP email system has several security advantages over typical encryption applications: if not already encrypted, incoming email is encrypted so that only the recipient can read it; email is always stored client-encrypted, both locally and when synchronized with the server; all message relay among service providers is required to be encrypted when possible; and public keys are automatically discovered and validated. In short, the Bitmask app offers full end-to-end encryption, quietly handling the complexities of public key encryption and allowing for backward compatibility with legacy email when necessary. Because the LEAP system is based on open, federated protocols, the user is able to change providers at will, preventing provider dependency and lock-in.",None,http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/J0VGxR4UcgVXxKM2uzQeN8B_Xig4tFh-r49xr17K7NAp0yt7HQML2mT4nV0f-blAuhZkYwS3j-sRXcT0msL6p6et4P3f1JF_,nan,LEAP Encryption Access Project,1,We make encryption easy to use.,python,twisted,javascript,openvpn,gnupg,e2e,mail,vpn,encryption,nan,https://leap.se,2018,nan

809,nan,"Mailing List: http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev   The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can beÂ used to build them. LLVM began as aÂ research projectÂ at theÂ University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety ofÂ commercial and open sourceprojects as well as being widely used inÂ academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under theÂ ""UIUC"" BSD-Style license. The primary sub-projects of LLVM are: TheÂ LLVM CoreÂ libraries provide a modern source- and target-independentÂ optimizer, along withÂ code generation supportÂ for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around aÂ well specifiedÂ code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (""LLVM IR""). The LLVM Core libraries areÂ well documented, and it is particularly easy to invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to useÂ LLVM as an optimizer and code generator. ClangÂ is an ""LLVM native"" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles (e.g. aboutÂ 3x faster than GCCwhen compiling Objective-C code in a debug configuration), extremely usefulÂ error and warning messagesÂ and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. TheÂ Clang Static AnalyzerÂ is a tool that automatically finds bugs in your code, and is a great example of the sort of tool that can be built using the Clang frontend as a library to parse C/C++ code. dragoneggÂ integrates the LLVM optimizers and code generator with the GCC 4.5 parsers. This allows LLVM to compile Ada, Fortran, and other languages supported by the GCC compiler frontends, and access to C features not supported by Clang (such as OpenMP). TheÂ LLDBÂ project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger. It uses the Clang ASTs and expression parser, LLVM JIT, LLVM disassembler, etc so that it provides an experience that ""just works"". It is also blazing fast and much more memory efficient than GDB at loading symbols. TheÂ libc++Â andÂ libc++ ABIÂ projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library, including full support for C++'0x. TheÂ compiler-rtÂ project provides highly tuned implementations of the low-level code generator support routines like ""__fixunsdfdi"" and other calls generated when a target doesn't have a short sequence of native instructions to implement a core IR operation. TheÂ vmkitÂ project is an implementation of the Java and .NET Virtual Machines that is built on LLVM technologies. TheÂ pollyÂ project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model. TheÂ libclcÂ project aims to implement the OpenCL standard library. TheÂ kleeÂ project implements a ""symbolic virtual machine"" which uses a theorem prover to try to evaluate all dynamic paths through a program in an effort to find bugs and to prove properties of functions. A major feature of klee is that it can produce a testcase in the event that it detects a bug. TheÂ SAFECodeÂ project is a memory safety compiler for C/C++ programs. It instruments code with run-time checks to detect memory safety errors (e.g., buffer overflows) at run-time. It can be used to protect software from security attacks and can also be used as a memory safety error debugging tool like Valgrind. In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects thatÂ use components of LLVM for various tasks. Through these external projects you can use LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Java, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, and a number of other languages. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers. As much as everything else, LLVM has a broad and friendly community of people who are interested in building great low-level tools. If you are interested in getting involved, a good first place is to skim theÂ LLVM BlogÂ and to sign up for theÂ LLVM Developer mailing list.

977,nan,"Mailing List: http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev   The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can beÂ used to build them. LLVM began as aÂ research projectÂ at theÂ University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety ofÂ commercial and open sourceprojects as well as being widely used inÂ academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under theÂ ""UIUC"" BSD-Style license. The primary sub-projects of LLVM are: TheÂ LLVM CoreÂ libraries provide a modern source- and target-independentÂ optimizer, along withÂ code generation supportÂ for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around aÂ well specifiedÂ code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (""LLVM IR""). The LLVM Core libraries areÂ well documented, and it is particularly easy to invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to useÂ LLVM as an optimizer and code generator. ClangÂ is an ""LLVM native"" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles (e.g. aboutÂ 3x faster than GCCwhen compiling Objective-C code in a debug configuration), extremely usefulÂ error and warning messagesÂ and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. TheÂ Clang Static AnalyzerÂ is a tool that automatically finds bugs in your code, and is a great example of the sort of tool that can be built using the Clang frontend as a library to parse C/C++ code. dragoneggÂ integrates the LLVM optimizers and code generator with the GCC 4.5 parsers. This allows LLVM to compile Ada, Fortran, and other languages supported by the GCC compiler frontends, and access to C features not supported by Clang (such as OpenMP). TheÂ LLDBÂ project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger. It uses the Clang ASTs and expression parser, LLVM JIT, LLVM disassembler, etc so that it provides an experience that ""just works"". It is also blazing fast and much more memory efficient than GDB at loading symbols. TheÂ libc++Â andÂ libc++ ABIÂ projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library, including full support for C++'0x. TheÂ compiler-rtÂ project provides highly tuned implementations of the low-level code generator support routines like ""__fixunsdfdi"" and other calls generated when a target doesn't have a short sequence of native instructions to implement a core IR operation. TheÂ vmkitÂ project is an implementation of the Java and .NET Virtual Machines that is built on LLVM technologies. TheÂ pollyÂ project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model. TheÂ libclcÂ project aims to implement the OpenCL standard library. TheÂ kleeÂ project implements a ""symbolic virtual machine"" which uses a theorem prover to try to evaluate all dynamic paths through a program in an effort to find bugs and to prove properties of functions. A major feature of klee is that it can produce a testcase in the event that it detects a bug. TheÂ SAFECodeÂ project is a memory safety compiler for C/C++ programs. It instruments code with run-time checks to detect memory safety errors (e.g., buffer overflows) at run-time. It can be used to protect software from security attacks and can also be used as a memory safety error debugging tool like Valgrind.

1493,nan,"Mailing List: llvmdev@cs.uiuc.edu       Â   Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is:   A compilation strategyÂ designed to enable effective program optimization across the entire lifetime of a program. LLVM supports effective optimization at compile time, link-time (particularly interprocedural), run-time and offline (i.e., after software is installed), while remaining transparent to developers and maintaining compatibility with existing build scripts. A virtual instruction setÂ - LLVM is a low-level object code representation that uses simple RISC-like instructions, but provides rich, language-independent, type information and dataflow (SSA) information about operands. This combination enables sophisticated transformations on object code, while remaining light-weight enough to be attached to the executable. This combination is key to allowing link-time, run-time, and offline transformations. A compiler infrastructureÂ - LLVM is also a collection of source code that implements the language and compilation strategy. The primary components of the LLVM infrastructure are a GCC-basedÂ C & C++ front-end, a link-time optimization framework with a growing set of global and interprocedural analyses and transformations, static back-ends for the X86, X86-64, PowerPC 32/64, ARM, Thumb, IA-64, Alpha, SPARC, MIPS and CellSPU architectures, a back-end which emits portable C code, and a Just-In-Time compiler for X86, X86-64, PowerPC 32/64 processors, and an emitter for MSIL. LLVM doesÂ notÂ imply things that you would expect from a high-level virtual machine. It does not require garbage collection or run-time code generation (In fact, LLVM makes a great static compiler!). Note that optional LLVM components can be used toÂ buildÂ high-level virtual machines and other systems that need these services.   LLVM is a robust system, particularly well suited for developing new mid-levelÂ language-independent analyses and optimizationsÂ of all sorts, including those that requireÂ extensive interprocedural analysis. LLVM is also a great target forfront-end developmentÂ for conventional or research programming languages, including those which requireÂ compile-time, link-time, or run-time optimizationÂ for effective implementation, proper tail calls or garbage collection. We have an incompleteÂ list of projectsÂ which have used LLVM for various purposes, showing that you can get up-and-running quickly with LLVM, giving time to do interesting things, even if you only have a semester in a University course. We also have a list ofÂ ideas for projectsÂ in LLVM.   SeeÂ http://www.llvm.orgÂ for more information.",nan,nan,http://llvm.org/OpenProjects.html,LLVM Compiler Infrastructure,5,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2010,nan

The ultimate goal is to build an operating system with a mean time to failure comparable to a TV set, which is to say, that the average user never experiences even a single failure during the entire period he or she owns the device. MINIX has evolved over the years. It started out as an educational tool, but has now become a serious system that could be used for applications where high reliability is important.

You are welcome to go directly to our ideas page, or to stay on this page to learn about M-Lab and the projects under its umbrella: DONAR and Paris Traceroute Measurement Lab (M-Lab) is an open, distributed server platform for researchers to deploy Internet measurement tools. The goal of M-Lab is to advance network research and empower the public with useful information about their broadband connections. By enhancing Internet transparency, M-Lab helps sustain a healthy, innovative Internet. When an Internet application doesn't work as expected, how can you tell whether the problem is caused by your broadband connection, the application or something else? It can be very difficult for professional network administrators, let alone average Internet users, to answer this sort of question today. Transparency has always been an essential component of the Internet's success, and Internet users deserve to be well-informed about the performance of their broadband connections. For that to happen, researchers need resources to develop new analytical tools. That's where M-Lab comes in. Many researchers are already developing tools that allow users to test their broadband connections by briefly communicating with a server elsewhere on the Internet. The M-Lab platform supports the development of these measurement tools. M-Lab assists scientific research by providing widely-distributed servers and ample connectivity for researchers' use. Each tool will be allocated dedicated resources on the M-Lab platform to facilitate accurate measurements. Server-side tools will be openly licensed and operated to allow third-parties to develop their own client-side measurement software. All data collected via M-Lab will be made available to the research community to allow researchers to build on a common pool of network measurement data. M-Lab is aÂ collaborative effortÂ led by researchers in partnership with companies and other institutions. Today, M-Lab is only at the beginning of its development. Five tools are currently available, running on 45 servers in 15 locations. In order to achieve our goals, M-Lab depends on the active support of additional partners, and we welcome input from anyone interested in helping the platform flourish. For more information, read this introduction to Measurement Lab and invitation to the research community to get involved, in the June ACM's Computer Communication Review availableÂ here. If you are an Internet user and want to run the tools,Â check out our Tools page. If you are a company, institution or researcher interested in learning more about using and supporting M-Lab,Â learn more here.

1641,nan,"Mailing List: mercurial@selenic.com   Mercurial is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS), and we would like to participate in 2009's Summer of Code. In recent years (notably since the Linux kernel project started looking for a new VCS), DVCSs have rapidly started to gain traction. For open source projects, especially, the use of a distributed system can be a great enabler, in that it's much easier to keep track of your own changes and publish them back to the community in a structured way. With centralized systems, you have a central repository that only a happy few have (write) access to, and people spend a lot of time mailing around diffs. With distributed systems, everyone has their own branch, and it's very easy to publish it on the web, compare the changes to those on some other branch or merge two branches back together. This has worked especially well since good DVCS hosting providers have come into being, like GitHub and Bitbucket.  Written largely in Python (with the exceptions of a few performance-critical core modules), it is easy to develop for and allows for good code organization and clean abstractions. Moreover, it has been optimized from the start for good performance, using an append-only datastore, minimizing random disk access and smart uses of compression. Finally, it has extensive features for sharing changesets, over HTTP, SSH and in files over email and has an innovative extension (Mercurial Queues) to help building and organizing changesets into a thoroughly useful source history.",nan,nan,http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/SummerOfCode,Mercurial,1,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2009,nan

It provides services to more than one million users every year, most of whom are university or college students, teachers, academics, scientist, and scholars. Each year, around one million books are lent. The library services are available for everybody over the age of 15. The National Library is one of the oldest public libraries in the Czech Republic with collections of a size far outranking any other library in the country. The value of its collections makes it one of the most important libraries both in Europe and in the world. It acquires, preserves, continuously updates, and provides access to rich collections of both domestic and foreign documents, especially of Bohemica and documents from the social and natural sciences areas. Historical collections are mostly of Czech and European origin. Main part of them consist of Bohemica, too. The core of the manuscript collection is formed by a set of codices donated by Charles IV to Prague University after the foundation of its first college in 1366. In addition, there are also oriental manuscripts and Greek papyri to be found there. The manuscript collection includes a large number of unique pieces as, for example, the Vysehrad Codex from the year 1085, created for the coronation of the first Czech King Vratislav, the Passional of the Abbess Kunhuta from the year 1312, produced in the scriptorium of the Convent of St. George at Prague Castle, the Velislav Pictorial Bible from the first half of the fourteenth century.

We offer a collaborative environment for scientists that are interested in learning and developing modern Human/Computer Interaction methods and concepts. Our research includes topics such as: computer vision, touch computing, voice & gesture recognition, and experience design and information visualization. We have participated in every GSoC event since 2008. Natural User Interfaces are becoming common in our everyday lives. Companies are rapidly introducing new product lines with NUI methodologies interwoven within; Google, Samsung, Apple, Microsoft and othersâ€_ all with a major push towards enhanced interaction. The class most influenced by the emergence so far is the â€œsmart mobileâ€ù as each unit contains 5-10 sensors paired with rich effectors. With 2011 seeming to be the year of the tablet both touch computing and our understanding of UX must scale once again as Android has shown with Fragments. Moving beyond mobile applications, entertainment devices like the Xbox Kinect Sensor give us new sensing abilities which officially registers on Windows 7 as NUI Audio, NUI Camera and NUI Motor devices, hinting towards the future. By participating in GSoC, we would like to expand the NUI concepts to a wider audience, raising interest from students around the world that do not typically have the opportunity to work with such technologies. We aim to study emerging sensing solutions and translate to applicable scenarios, starting with computer vision, natural language, and signal processing. Beyond that students can ponder on innovative problems that include related developments in clustering algorithms, image processing and machine learning. With over 12,000 members, our goals is to accelerate the exploration of sensing solutions and interaction scenarios, thus allowing us to find the most effective methods of constructing modern interface devices. Our members are a worldwide gathering of students, researchers, designers, developers and engineers all who share a similar passion for the creation and distribution of open systems. An important aspect is to create and utilize open standards that allow development to flourish. An example is our Community Core Vision or CCV project which is built in OpenFrameworks and supports several communications modes (Binary, TUIO, OSC and XML). The project is nearing one million total downloads and has introduced computer vision to a whole new audience, lowering the entry bar for new researchers while remaining powerful for advanced use and content creators. We would like to thank Google Summer of Code Project and the amazing contributors for making this a possible. Everyone in the community is really excited about GSoC 2011 as last year set the stage for our Core Platform, Which aims to manage voice and visual signals and route to clients build in AS3/Java/Python. This year we would like to continue our development with focus on several key projects: Community Core Services (C/C++): Community Client Frameworks: Framework Goals - Development and standardization of target frameworks including structure, documentation and release packages.

OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for developers to produce applications utilising hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. The class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes. What can it do?Lots of things! See the features page for an up-to-date list of the current features. Also, take a look at the screenshots page to see for yourself the kinds of eye candy OGRE can pump out. Is OGRE A Game Engine?No. OGRE can be (and indeed has been) used to make games, but OGRE is deliberately designed to provide just a world-class graphics solution; for other features like sound, networking, AI, collision, physics etc, you will need to integrate it with other libraries, something several frameworks have done, and we have a collision / physics reference integration library as an example in our distribution. Why? Well, one reason is that not everyone who needs a 3D engine wants to make games, so we donâ€™t assume that you do â€“ you can use OGRE for games, simulations, business applications, anything at all. Secondly, even within the games industry, requirements can vary widely; for example a MMORPG will need a very different kind of network library than an FPS, and a flight sim will need a different kind of collision / physics system to fighting game. If OGRE included all these features, we would be enforcing a particular set of libraries on you, with an inbuilt set of assumed requirements, and thatâ€™s not good design. Instead, we provide a very integration friendly API and let YOU choose the other libraries, if you want them. Many experienced game developers have expressed their approval of this approach, because there are no inbuilt constraints. It can be more daunting for newer users who just want to build another FPS-style game, but for those people there are a growing number of existing frameworks using OGRE which provide a complete solution using a given combo of libraries; but itâ€™s important to realise that OGRE itself will always remain separate, flexible enough to be incorporated into any of these. The principle is of collaboration and integration with other libraries, rather than assimilation of them, a standard tenet of component-based design. Why should I consider using OGRE (rather than the other zillion 3D engines out there)?Many other engines, whilst technically impressive, lack the cohesive design and the consistent documentation to allow them to be used effectively. Many of them have long features lists, but have the feel of a bunch of tech demos lashed together with twine, with no clear vision to hold them together. Like any other software system this becomes their downfall as they become larger. Most other engines are also designed for one particular style of game or demo (e.g. first-person shooters, terrain roamers). OGRE is different. OGRE is design-led rather than feature-led. Every feature that goes into OGRE is considered throughly and slotted into the overall design as elegantly as possible and is always fully documented, meaning that the features which are there always feel part of a cohesive whole. Quality is favoured over quantity, because quantity can come later â€“ quality can never be added in retrospect. OGRE uses sound design principles learned, tried and tested many times in commercial-grade software â€“ the object-orientation mentioned in itâ€™s moniker is just one of those approaches â€“ frequent use of design patterns is another. The core development team is kept deliberately small, and all of its members are veteren software engineers with many years of real-world experience. Patches are welcomed from community, but they undergo a strict review for both quality and cohesion with the Ogre philosophy before being accepted. OGRE does not assume what type of game or demo you want to make. It uses a flexible class hierarchy allowing you to design plugins to specialise the scene organisation approach taken to allow you to make any kind of scene you like. Want to render indoor levels fast? Fine, use the BSP/PVS plugin scene manager which has already been written. Want an outdoor landscape? Again, use another plugin scene manager. The rest of the engine continues to function exactly as before. So the short answer is â€“ if you favour design quality, flexibility and clear documentation, choose OGRE. You know it makes sense.Â [IMAGE http://www.ogre3d.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif] Is it really free?The Ogre source is made available under the MIT License, which basically means you can use it however you like as long as you include the content of our COPYING file somewhere in your application. The source to your application, or your modifications to Ogre do not have to be released (although it would be nice if you did). See the licensing page for full licensing terms. How do I find out more?If you want to find out about the principles under which OGRE has been developed and to get a quick overview of the design, go to the OGRE Manual now. You can also read the tutorials to help you get started, and then reference the API documentation online. The best way to appreciate OGRE is to use it.

The methods for solving these different tasks can be very different and highly targeted for that special object type. Because of this reason we have implementation of crude detection/recognition algorithms scattered over different places without any common standard. Even with the availability of dedicated computer vision libraries like OpenCV/PCL, implementation of a simple object detection application based on the existing techniques is not a trivial task as it should be.Thus, the purpose of this library is to contribute in this field and make available the existing solution in this direction in a common, very structured, and a very user-friendly APIs.

1188,nan,"Mailing List: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/open-lighting   The Open Lighting Project is an effort to build high quality, open source software for the entertainment lighting industry.Â Â  Brief Background of Entertainment Lighting Entertainment lighting is used in venues such as theaters, bars, theme parks, and cruise ships and the industry has typically been slow to adopt new technologies. Until recently, most lighting equipment has been controlled over a unidirectional RS-485 channel, using the DMX512 standard (written in 1986, revised since and now know as ANSI E1.11 - 2008). The use of a serial link severely limits data rate, and means data distribution products such as wireless links are expensive due to the small market. In the late 1990s, the growing popularity of Ethernet led to some within the industry to consider DMX over IP protocols. By the early 2000s, no less than 6 DMX over IP protocols had been developed, some proprietary and others public. An effort commenced to define an industry standard protocol, but scope creep meant this wasnâ€™t published until 2009. The Open Lighting Project The Open Lighting Project was started in 2004 as a college honors project. The flagship product, OLA (Open Lighting Architecture: http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/Open_Lighting_Architecture) now supports 5 DMX-over-IP protocols. This was initially done by reverse engineering but recently some manufacturers have released the specifications of their proprietary protocols. OLA enables end users to use lighting equipment from different manufacturers on an IP network, freeing customers from vendor lock in.Â  OLA also supports 17 USB to DMX512 adaptors, allowing users to distribute the DMX control information over IP and then convert to traditional DMX512 for legacy devices. OLA also supports ANSI E1.31 (2009), the new standard for DMX over IP. In 2010 we began work on RDM (Remote Device Management: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDM_(lighting) ), a relatively new standard published by ANSI in 2006 which, for the first time, enables bi-directional control of lighting devices. This means that rather than relying on visual inspections, lighting operators can be notified when abnormal conditions such as over heating occur with the lighting devices. RDM is starting to see significant uptake within the industry. Since 2010, weâ€™ve been involved in the standards process for ANSI E1.33, a new protocol for transporting RDM information over IP. OLA is being used as a sandbox to test E1.33, as a way of ensuring the protocol works correctly before the standard is published. In early 2011 we released the Automated RDM Responder Tests (http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/RDM_Responder_Testing), a collection of test cases which can be used to evaluate the quality of RDM enabled lighting hardware. Due to the industryâ€™s small size, many manufacturers do not have mature software engineering processes in place, so much of testing has been manual. The release of an open source automated testing suite was groundbreaking for the industry and the software is now used by the many of the manufacturers as part of their QA process.",nan,nan,http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/OLA_SOC_Ideas_Page,Open Lighting Project,1,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2012,https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2012/orgs/openlighting/logo-200.png

1511,nan,"Mailing List: OpenCV@yahoogroups.com   The Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV)is an open, free for commercial use, computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV contains a comprehensive set of both classic and state of the art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used, for example, to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database, remove red eye from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenes and establish markers to overlay the scenes with augmented reality to name a few. OpenCV has well over 2 million downloads, has an active user group with over 41 thousand registered members. The O'Reilly coding book on OpenCV, ""Learning OpenCV"" has been the best selling computer vision or machine vision book for a year and a half no. OpenCV is used extensively in companies, research groups and by governmental bodies.  Some well known companies that use OpenCV are Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Sony, Honda, Toyota. Many startups such as Applied Minds, VideoSurf, and Zeitera make extensive use of OpenCV. OpenCV's deployed uses span the range from stitching streetview images together, detecting intrusions in surveillance video in Israel, monitoring mine equipment in China (more notoriously, OpenCV is a key part of China's ""Green Dam"" internet filtering software ), helping robots navigate and pick up objects at Willowgarage, detection swimming pool drowning events in Europe, running interactive art in Spain and New York, checking run ways for derbies in Turkey, inspecting labels on products in factories around the world on to rapid face detection in Japan.  OpenCV leans mostly towards real time vision applications and takes advantage of MMX and SSE instructions when available. A CUDA interface is being developed right now. There are over 500 algorithms and about 10 times as many functions that compose or support those algorithms. OpenCV is written natively in C++ and has a templated interface that works seamlessly with std containers. Its native data type is a general matrix class that reference counts and leverages LAPACK and (in April) EIGEN. OpenCV also has a full custom Python interface and, using SWIG, OpenCV has interfaces to Matlab and Octave. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. To enable this, OpenCV has a BSD license to make it easy for businesses to use and modify the code.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers.  Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all.  To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts.  As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships.

They record street names, village names and other features using notebooks, digital cameras, and voice-recorders.

TUBITAK (The National Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) UEKAE (National Research Institute for Electronic and Cryptography) is a government-run research institute in Turkey. TUBITAK (http://www.tubitak.gov.tr) is the scientific research funding organization of Turkey - a la NSF, and UEKAE is one of the research institutes of TUBITAK - a la Max Planck.   TUBITAK UEKAE is located in Gebze, ca. 50 km from Istanbul, and has offices in Ankara as well. TUBITAK UEKAE has more than 500 researchers working in the fields of information security and cryptography. Â  Pardus project has a triad of goals: Developing Linux distribution for widespread use in Turkey and elsewhere, to have some sound financial sustainability even though the mother organization is a not-for-profit, and finally to develop a FOSS ecosystem in Turkey and elsewhere to innovate in Linux and related technologies.   Pardus, the distribution, is the main tool to achieve these goals, and has, in turn, three fundamental requirements: Having full Turkish (i.e. mostly UTF-8) support, ease of use and installation, and a human-centric and task-based design approach (instead of a technology-centric and tool-based one).

Pardus is a Linux distribution development project under the auspices of TUBITAK UEKAE. TUBITAK (The National Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) UEKAE (National Research Institute for Electronic and Cryptography) is a government-run research institute in Turkey. TUBITAK (http://www.tubitak.gov.tr) is the scientific research funding organization of Turkey - a la NSF, and UEKAE is one of the research institutes of TUBITAK - a la Max Planck. TUBITAK UEKAE is located in Gebze, ca. 50 km from Istanbul, and has offices in Ankara as well. TUBITAK UEKAE has more than 500 researchers working in the fields of information security and cryptography. Pardus project has a triad of goals: Developing Linux distribution for widespread use in Turkey and elsewhere, to have some sound financial sustainability even though the mother organization is a not-for-profit, and finally to develop a FOSS ecosystem in Turkey and elsewhere to innovate in Linux and related technologies. Pardus, the distribution, is the main tool to achieve these goals, and has, in turn, three fundamental requirements: Having full Turkish (i.e. mostly UTF-8) support, ease of use and installation, and a human-centric and task-based design approach (instead of a technology-centric and tool-based one). Pardus project has been launched in Fall 2003 and the technical roadmap has been laid of in Fall 2004. The Pardus developers consist of 15 TUBITAK UEKAE employed core developers (10 full-time, 2 part-time) and more  than 30 community developers.

The focus is on assembly of concurrent components. The key underlying principle in the project is the use of well-defined models of computation that govern the interaction between components. A major problem area being addressed is the use of heterogeneous mixtures of models of computation. A software system called Ptolemy II is being constructed in Java. Ptolemy II differs from other commonly used graphical block-diagram languages in that they typically support only one model of computation. In addition, Ptolemy II is a more open architecture in that its infrastructure is open source, and the interfaces to the core mechanisms in the software are published and documented.     The Ptolemy project has been under development in Java since 1997. The work is conducted in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences of the University of California, Berkeley. Currently, full-time members of the project include 1 director, 3 system/sw managers, 5 postdoctoral/visiting scholars, 11 grad students, 2 visitors, 2 undergrad students (details at http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/people/main.htm ).

We're grateful to have support from organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Google.org, and AT&T Foundation.Improving Education with Innovative TechnologyQuill was recently featured in Fast Company and the Google Machine Learning blog for our work applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to helping learners become better writers and critical thinkers. We leverage this technology alongside a proven curriculum of learning techniques from top educational researchers.Learners begin by completing a diagnostic activity that provides the learning management system enough information to predict where the student is strong and where they need improvement. Then, teachers can assign follow up activities that provide practice targeted specifically to where the student is falling short. (There are even special versions of the diagnostic for English language learners whose first languages are Spanish, Mandarin, French, Vietnamese, Arabic, and Hindi.)Quill has a variety of activity types, including a real-time classroom lessons mode, a sentence construction tool, a proofreading practice tool and a grammar practice tool.Each tool has associated algorithms for assessing and providing targeted feedback in response to student submissions. These algorithms utilize rules-based logic, natural language processing, and machine learning.What's Next?Up until now, Quill has primarily been built as a tool for educators to use with their students. This means that Quill does not currently have a self-study mode for learners who are not in a classroom setting. We're excited for the GSoC community to help leverage Quill's progress so far into a learning tool that can assist millions of learners around the world who deserve better education.",00c3a2,http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CHPiRA9590fHfBQ02NwN2zhkYtvjaI6DpI44mOuXOOoLeE3JtIwYx_0_k3-hb-W2QndF65EjL22oVy3fAeNXvk75fa2QWfc,nan,Quill.org,1,Helping millions of learners become better writers and critical thinkers,ruby,rails,react,javascript,postgresql,education,edtech,machine learning,nlp,web,https://quill.org,2018,nan

Such tiny IoT devices often have CPU and memory resources so constrained (e.g. a few kilobytes of RAM and ROM), that Linux cannot even hope to run on them. In this case: consider running RIOT, the most exciting OS for Internet of Things devices. RIOT enables a programmer to develop applications on IoT devices with zero learning curve, with basic knowledge of C and Linux system programming. The long term goal of the project is to simplify the programming of constrained IoT devices by providing a de facto standard development environment for these devices - similarly to Linux on PCs and Android/iOS on mobile devices. The RIOT community gathers 50+ contributors from all over the world, from both academic and industrial backgrounds. We put great emphasis on transparent processes and open development. The development processes are built around git, GitHub and open forums (mailing lists discussions which gather hundreds of people). Through these open processes, newcomers are welcomed, guided, and actively encouraged to get involved.

Â  The Rockbox project is a complete portable digital audio player replacement firmware - including operating system, GUI and application suite. It has been in development since 2001 and receives new features, tweaks and fixes every day to provide you with the best possible music listening experience. Rockbox aims to be considerably more functional and efficient than your device's stock firmware while remaining easy to use and customizable. It is a goal to not only offer a wide range of functionality, but where possible make sure that this functionality is presented in a consistent manner that is easy to learn and use. Rockbox runs on a wide range of platforms including devices from Archos, Apple (iPod), iriver, Cowon, Olympus, Toshiba and SanDisk with more in development. The development team consists of over 50 active committers and nearly 600 individual contributors. See http://www.rockbox.org/wiki/WhyRockbox for more information. Thanks to previous Google Summer of Code projects, Rockbox is staying relevant with the changes in digital audio listening. The ""Rockbox as an App"" movement began, to provide the same freedom in audio tasks as we have for years past in dedicated digital audio players. This movement has been successful, and Rockbox now runs as an application on multiple smartphone platforms. We have large userbases in the blind community as well. Since Rockbox has a spoken interface, it has provided them with the ability to navigate and listen to their audio on the go. Audiophile users use Rockbox for its many ""tweaks"" that can be done to audio, to say nothing of our massive audio codec support. Open source and freedom lovers enjoy the ability to make their devices do whatever they wish it to do, as well as get away from many proprietary and closed formats. Rockbox also has developed the most comprehensive collection of open source, fixed point and ARM optimized audio decoders in existence. Our project has optimized more than 30 open source decoders for minimum memory requirements and very high power efficiency on embedded devices. Additionally, we have developed several new fixed point decoders which have been incorporated into libraries such as ffmpeg and VLC, and into mobile phone applications. Working on Rockbox provides several opportunities that can not easily be found elsewhere. There is work close to the hardware, possibly involving reverse engineering. Other people may prefer working on audio codecs - either porting existing code to work in rockbox using only fixed point calculations, or optimising codecs that are already supported. Students who want to improve their SCSI or USB knowledge and skills can do so. All of this, and much more, is done within the constraints and challenges of embedded systems. There is a very active development community, with people who are very knowledgeable in each of these fields and more ready to help others work and learn.",nan,nan,http://www.rockbox.org/wiki/SummerOfCode2011,Rockbox,2,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2011,https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2011/orgs/rockbox/logo-200.png

691,nan,"Mailing List: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sciruby-dev   We believe that the time for a Ruby science and visualization package has come. Sometimes when a solution of sugar and water becomes super-saturated, from it precipitates a pure, delicious, and diabetes-inducing crystal of sweetness, induced by no more than the tap of a finger. So it is today with numeric and visualization libraries for Ruby. The SciRuby projectÂ is oriented towards providing computational research infrastructure. Infrastructure was the single common area of need identified by scientists, researchers, and engineers in discussions at the GSoC 2013 mentor summit. SciRuby consists of a fairly large number of gems, including statsample, statsample-glm, statsample-timeseries, distribution, minimization, integration, rubyvis, plotrb, Nyaplot, MDArray, Publisci, Ruby-Band, and NMatrix. The last of these has been awarded grants by the Ruby Association (which develops the Ruby language) as well as Brighter Planet, and has a goal of supplying Ruby with a robust, versatile linear algebra library with support for both dense and sparse matrices. Statsample and its related packages (e.g., distribution) aim to provide the Ruby language with statistical analysis packages. A major portion of our gems have been written by GSoC studentsÂ â€” including Nyaplot, plotrb, PubliSci, Ruby-Band, statsample-timeseries, and statsample-glm. Others, like minimization and integration, have been overhauled over the course of Summer of Code projects. Working on SciRuby is a chance to get involved at the ground floor on a project which is viewed as critical by many Rubyists, including Ruby's creator, Matz. Further, since we are a science-related project, we expect that successful student projects could lead to publications.

It is a web based collaboration tool that addresses the common coordination problems during emergencies and disasters that provides capabilities such as:  * finding missing people  * managing aid  * managing volunteers  * tracking camps effectively between Government groups, the civil society (NGOs) and the victims themselves.  Sahana is now a mature application with a solid track record of success.  It has recently been adopted as the national disaster management system by the countries of Indonesia and the Philippines; It is used by the New York City to manage its sheltering plan and by Bethesda, Maryland for missing persons; It was used in China for the Chengdu-Sitzuan earthquake, in Peru for the Ica earthquake, in Pakistan for the Kashmir earthquake, in India for the Bihar floods, and in several other countries.  Most recently, the Sahana Software Foundation supported the deployment of Sahana software in response to the massive earthquakes in Haiti and Chile.  The Sahana Software Foundation, a non-profit organization established in 2009 to promote FOSS solutions for disaster and emergency management, now supports multiple projects in the humanitarian free and open source software space, including our original PHP project and a Python project using web2py.

370,Programming Languages and Development Tools,"Our MissionDevelop and promote adoption of a specification to enable any party in a software supply chain, from the original author to the final end user, to accurately communicate the licensing information for any piece of copyrightable material that such party may create, alter, combine, pass on, or receive, and to make such information available in a consistent, understandable, and re-usable fashion, with the aim of facilitating license and other policy compliance.Our VisionThe vision of SPDX is achieve license compliance with minimal cost across the supply chain. Ideally, upstream component developers begin the process by supplying SPDX flies as part of their downloads. Users of those components therefore have a starting point for the SPDX files they create for their ""customers,"" and so on. If everything is working properly, the provenance of each piece of code is researched and documented only once during its journey through a supply chain, and that information is passed on in parallel with the code in the SPDX format.ExecutionDevelopment of SPDX is run somewhat like an open source project: Those that participate influence. Decisions tend to be made by consensus. The spec itself is writen by a technical team with input and support from business and legal teams. Although much of the the initial focus was on Linux and the project is under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, the strategy from the outset has been much broader to be applicable to anything open source. To accommodate a range of needs, SPDX can be implemented in XML or tag-value formats.The SPDX ""IP"" is all housed on this site.

With Soletta Project's libraries developers can easily write software for devices that control actuators/sensors (I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO, ADC, PWM and others) and communicate using standard technologies (OIC, CoAP, HTTP, MQTT, LWM2M, Mavlink and others). It enables adding smartness even on the smallest edge devices.Portable and scalable, it abstracts details of hardware and OS, enabling developers to reuse their code and knowledge on different targets. The framework has ports done to the following targets:LinuxZephyr OSRIOT OS(Partially) Contiki OSBy writing a Soletta application, it's a matter of parametrising specific OS values, like GPIO pin numbers and such (Soletta already eases that task) and, with a makefile that builds with the respective toolchains/SDKs, the same application would be functional for all supported targets.One of the ways Soletta exposes of writing applications is by flow-based programming (FBP), which allows the programmer to express business logic as a directional graph of nodes connected to type-specific ports.The connected node ports will exchange information packets (IP) that will be used to run the flow. The packet can be either empty, used just to trigger an action, or carry a value such as booleans, integers, floats and even complex data types such as blobs. Ports can decide if the packets they produce will be queued or replaced if they were not consumed by target ports when a new packet is to be produced.For those used to traditional object oriented programming (OOP) it's like using the observer pattern on source nodes, calling the associated data getter which is then forwarded to target nodes by calling their setter. However this is done by the core in an efficient and safe way as no memory leaks, type mismatch or invalid memory access can happen.Besides that, Soletta exposes all its functionality on a C API, so that FBP is not mandatory.",None,http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8OmsKRY9i3R3AoQOrow_zrz9jlzjaOSIXW9m2e7cCviUzCO6V3_ny6_KC9cAOuJTWIzWtDemuapvM6YV0joi1QsThI7UcvvR,nan,Soletta Project,3,Soletta Project is an open source framework for making IoT applications,c,python,javascript,networking,machine learning,internet of things,portable,robotics,drones,makers,https://solettaproject.org/,2016,nan

Sugar Labs coordinates volunteersâ€”international community of teachers, software developers, artists and writers, parents and childrenâ€”who are passionate about providing educational opportunities to children through the Sugar Learning Platform. Globally, there are teachers that discuss how they use Sugar in their classrooms; students who blog about their Sugar learning experiences; and everyone, not just software engineers, contribute to the code base. (Children as young as 12-years old have written Sugar activities and we regularly receive patches from 15-year-olds.) At Sugar Labs, we promote investing locally in learning that works for every child. While there are many great ICT-oriented learning projects, what distinguishes Sugar is its platform features. Like a sponge, Sugar pulls in projects such as Gcompris, Etoys, Scratch, and Open Office for Children, as well as hundreds of learning activities specifically written for Sugar, making those great tools available to more children. But the Sugar platform further enhances the learning experience through its mechanisms of collaboration and reflection. With Sugar, the computer represents more than an opportunity for interaction with isolated applications; it is the manifestation of a change in the culture of learning. Sugar will engage even the youngest learner in the use of computation as a powerful â€œthing to think with.â€ù They will quickly become proficient in using the computer as a tool to engage in authentic problem-solving. Sugar users develop skills that help them in all aspects of life.The Sugar software is a learning platform designed for children, originally designed for the XO laptop of the OLPC project, but completely independent of OLPC since Q1 2008.

874,nan,"Mailing List: mailto:supertuxkart-devel@lists.sourceforge.net   What is SuperTuxKart? SuperTuxKart is an open source 3d kart racing game. We want to make the game fun more than we want to make it realistic. You can play with up to 4 friends on one PC, racing against each other or just try to beat the computer. See the great lighthouse or drive through the sand and visit the pyramids. Race underground or in space, watching the stars passing by. Have some rest under the palms on the beach (watching the other karts overtaking you :) ). But don't eat the bananas! Watch for bowling balls, plungers, bubble gum and cakes thrown by opponents. You can do a single race against other karts, compete in one of several Grand Prix, try to beat the high score in time trials on your own, play battle mode against your friends, and more!

197,Programming Languages and Development Tools,"TLA stands for the Temporal Logic of Actions, but it has become a shorthand for referring to the TLA+ specification language and the PlusCal algorithm language, together with their associated tools.TLA+ is based on the idea that the best way to describe things formally is with simple mathematics, and that a specification language should contain as little as possible beyond what is needed to write simple mathematics precisely. TLA+ is especially well suited for writing high-level specifications of concurrent and distributed systems.PlusCal is an algorithm language that, at first glance, looks like a typical tiny toy programming language. However, a PlusCal expression can be any TLA+ expression, which means anything that can be expressed with mathematics. This makes PlusCal much more expressive than any (real or toy) programming language. A PlusCal algorithm is translated into a TLA+ specification, to which the TLA+ tools can be applied.The principal TLA+ tools are the TLC model checker and TLAPS, the TLA+ proof system. All the tools are normally used from the Toolbox, an IDE (integrated development environment).

Although the core rules are fairly simple and meant to be easily learned[1], they provide interesting gameplay and rich tactical options. A major strength of the project is the Wesnoth Markup Language (WML) for writing scenarios. Programming skills are not required to compose with it, and a large WML-modding community has generated a great deal of user-maintained content. We polish the best of this content and lift it into our official release tree. The first stable release (1.0) was on October 2, 2005, and the latest stable release (1.8) happened in April 2010. Version 1.8 is a major stable checkpoint, and 1.10 is not anticipated before the end of 2011. The current development cycle (1.9, leading to 1.10) will premier significant changes in gameplay, UI, and development tools, with many new concepts being introduced. That makes this year probably one of the best years for a SoC student to join, since the open-ended 1.9 will mean much more space to develop novel ideas. Wesnothis one of the most successful open-source game projects in existence, with an exceptionally large developer base and user community: Wesnoth's most notable features include: For our Ideas page, please have a look at [5].

The FreeBSD Project began 15 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work at Berkeley CSRG with open source revision history going back 30 years to 1978.      There are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce servers for experimental and third party development (this is also where our summer of code students have worked in previous years).      We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website.      FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.      In addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM, and OpenPAM.",nan,nan,http://www.freebsd.org/projects/summerofcode.html,The FreeBSD Project,17,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2009,nan

1710,nan,"Mailing List: devl@freenetproject.org   Freenet is free software which lets you publish and obtain information on the Internet without fear of censorship. To achieve this freedom, the network is entirely decentralized and publishers and consumers of information are anonymous. Without anonymity there can never be true freedom of speech, and without decentralization the network will be vulnerable to attack. Communications by Freenet nodes are encrypted and are ""routed-through"" other nodes to make it extremely difficult to determine who is requesting the information and what its content is. Users contribute to the network by giving bandwidth and a portion of their hard drive (called the ""data store"") for storing files. Unlike other peer-to-peer file sharing networks, Freenet does not let the user control what is stored in the data store. Instead, files are kept or deleted depending on how popular they are, with the least popular being discarded to make way for newer or more popular content. Files in the data store are encrypted to reduce the likelihood of prosecution by persons wishing to censor Freenet content. The network can be used in a number of different ways and isn't restricted to just sharing files like other peer-to-peer networks. It acts more like an Internet within an Internet. For example Freenet can be used for: * Publishing websites or 'freesites' * Communicating via message boards * Content distribution * Sending email messages Unlike many cutting edge projects, Freenet long ago escaped the science lab, it has been downloaded by over 2 million users since the project started, and it is used for the distribution of censored information all over the world including countries such as China and the Middle East. Ideas and concepts pioneered in Freenet have had a significant impact in the academic world. Our 2000 paper ""Freenet: A Distributed Anonymous Information Storage and Retrieval System"" was the most cited computer science paper of 2000 according to Citeseer, and Freenet has also inspired papers in the worlds of law and philosophy. Ian Clarke, Freenet's creator and project coordinator, was selected as one of the top 100 innovators of 2003 by MIT's Technology Review magazine.",nan,nan,http://wiki.freenetproject.org/SummerOfCode2009,The Freenet Project,5,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2009,nan

For over 15 years, everything we have done and continue to do is based on the principles of opensource and volunteer efforts. OurÂ bylaws specifically state that any software or papers developed and published by the organization must be licensed as open source and made freely available to the community. Our goal is to help coordinate the development, deployment, advancement and research findings of honeypot related technologies. With over forty five international chapters, three hundred and fifty members and thirty open source research projects around around the world, we are a mature, highly diverse and international organization. Simply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this goal in the following three ways: Awareness We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals and organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information so people can better understand they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This information is provided through ourÂ Know Your Enemy series of papers. Information For those who are already aware and concerned, we provide details to better secure and defend your resources. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through ourÂ Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodicÂ Scan of the Month challenges. Tools For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. We provide these through our Tools Site. Learn more at http://www.honeynet.org. Google Summer of Code 2015 This year in Google Summer of Code we have a wide range ofÂ project ideas and we are also interested in your ideas that advance the community knowledge into new areas. Our projects and skill sets cover a wide range of programming languages (C, C++, python, PHP, perl, java, javascript, Processing, etc), database/SQL, IP networking, kernel and device driver development, UI and web interface development, databases, intrusion detection systems (IDS), proxies, data visualization, etc. Project idea difficulty can range from fairly challenging, low level root kit / kernel / hypervizor modification type projects that are likely to appeal to pretty confident programmers, through to less code intensive but equally interesting data analysis and data presentation projects building effective user interfaces. We are always interested in discussing students own project ideas and actively aim to mentor high quality student ideas too. If you want to find out more, take a look at ourÂ project ideas web page, subscribe to ourÂ blog and public GSoC questions mailing list, then come and say hello on the #gsoc-honeynet IRC channel on irc.freenode.net (you can connect viaÂ webchat if you are behind a firewall or don't have a command line client too).

1413,nan,"Mailing List: http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev   Â  The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can beÂ used to build them. LLVM began as aÂ research projectÂ at theÂ University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety ofÂ commercial and open sourceÂ projects as well as being widely used inÂ academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under theÂ ""UIUC"" BSD-Style license. The primary sub-projects of LLVM are: TheÂ LLVM CoreÂ libraries provide a modern source- and target-independentÂ optimizer, along withÂ code generation supportÂ for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around aÂ well specifiedÂ code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (""LLVM IR""). The LLVM Core libraries areÂ well documented, and it is particularly easy to invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to useÂ LLVM as an optimizer and code generator. ClangÂ is an ""LLVM native"" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles (e.g. aboutÂ 3x faster than GCCÂ when compiling Objective-C code in a debug configuration), extremely usefulÂ error and warning messagesÂ and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. TheÂ Clang Static Analyzeris a tool automatically finds bugs in your code, and is a great example of the sort of tool that can be built using the Clang frontend as a library to parse C/C++ code. dragoneggÂ andÂ llvm-gcc 4.2Â integrate the LLVM optimizers and code generator with the GCC 4.5 (which is GPL3) and GCC 4.2 (which is GPL2) parsers, respectively. This allows LLVM to compile Ada, Fortran, and other languages supported by the GCC compiler frontends, and provides high-fidelity drop-in compatibility with their respective versions of GCC. TheÂ LLDBÂ project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger. It uses the Clang ASTs and expression parser, LLVM JIT, LLVM disassembler, etc so that it provides an experience that ""just works"". It is also blazing fast and much more memory efficient than GDB at loading symbols. TheÂ libc++Â project provides a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library, with an aim of supporting C++'0x when the standard is ratified. TheÂ compiler-rtÂ project provides highly tuned implementations of the low-level code generator support routines like ""__fixunsdfdi"" and other calls generated when a target doesn't have a short sequence of native instructions to implement a core IR operation. TheÂ vmkitÂ project is an implementation of the Java and .NET Virtual Machines that is built on LLVM technologies. TheÂ kleeÂ project implements a ""symbolic virtual machine"" which uses a theorem prover to try to evaluate all dynamic paths through a program, in an effort to find bugs and to prove properties of functions. A major feature of klee is that it can produce a testcase in the event that it detects a bug. In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects thatÂ use components of LLVM for various tasks. Through these external projects you can use LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Java, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, and a number of other languages. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers. As much as everything else, LLVM has a broad and friendly community of people who are interested in building great low-level tools.

TheÂ Clang Static AnalyzerÂ is a tool that automatically finds bugs in your code, and is a great example of the sort of tool that can be built using the Clang frontend as a library to parse C/C++ code. dragoneggÂ integrates the LLVM optimizers and code generator with the GCC 4.5 parsers. This allows LLVM to compile Ada, Fortran, and other languages supported by the GCC compiler frontends, and access to C features not supported by Clang (such as OpenMP). TheÂ LLDBÂ project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger. It uses the Clang ASTs and expression parser, LLVM JIT, LLVM disassembler, etc so that it provides an experience that ""just works"". It is also blazing fast and much more memory efficient than GDB at loading symbols. TheÂ libc++Â andÂ libc++ ABIÂ projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library, including full support for C++'0x. TheÂ compiler-rtÂ project provides highly tuned implementations of the low-level code generator support routines like ""__fixunsdfdi"" and other calls generated when a target doesn't have a short sequence of native instructions to implement a core IR operation. TheÂ vmkitÂ project is an implementation of the Java and .NET Virtual Machines that is built on LLVM technologies. TheÂ pollyÂ project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model. TheÂ libclcÂ project aims to implement the OpenCL standard library. TheÂ kleeÂ project implements a ""symbolic virtual machine"" which uses a theorem prover to try to evaluate all dynamic paths through a program in an effort to find bugs and to prove properties of functions. A major feature of klee is that it can produce a testcase in the event that it detects a bug. TheÂ SAFECodeÂ project is a memory safety compiler for C/C++ programs. It instruments code with run-time checks to detect memory safety errors (e.g., buffer overflows) at run-time. It can be used to protect software from security attacks and can also be used as a memory safety error debugging tool like Valgrind. In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects thatÂ use components of LLVM for various tasks. Through these external projects you can use LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Java, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, and a number of other languages. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers. As much as everything else, LLVM has a broad and friendly community of people who are interested in building great low-level tools. If you are interested in getting involved, a good first place is to skim theÂ LLVM BlogÂ and to sign up for theÂ LLVM Developer mailing list. For information on how to send in a patch, get commit access, and copyright and license topics, please seeÂ the LLVM Developer Policy.",nan,nan,http://llvm.org/OpenProjects.html,The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure,5,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2012,https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2012/orgs/llvm/logo-200.png

That is, we're undertaking a serious effort to build a thinking machine. We've developed a detailed plan, possess the ability to execute it, and we're proceeding with the hard work step-by-step. As compared to most academic and industry AI research, the OpenCog project has a very different focus. We are not centrally concerned with building more accurate classification algorithms, or more efficient computer vision systems, or better language processing or information retrieval algorithms, etc. Neither are we centrally concerned with building a program that performs only one specific task like play chess, diagnose diseases, answer trivia questions, or drive a car. We are concerned with generic intelligence and the inter-related cognitive processes it entails. OpenCog is a moderate-sized and active project with: a team in Hong Kong working on NLP and robotics; an OpenCog lab in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with a staff of 10 developers; a distributed group of developers in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Australasia, working for various employers and applying OpenCog on commercial and government projects; and many fantastic volunteer developers. Â  Our vision is a huge one and we are eagerly recruiting new developers!Â  The core functionality is in a mostly C++ codebase hosted on Github. Some portions are coded in python and Scheme.

194,Data and Databases,"Over years working in data visualization, weâ€™ve sought to build tools that help designers craft sophisticated graphics, including systems such as Prefuse, Protovis and D3.js. However, in the grand scheme of things, â€œartisanalâ€ù visualizations hand-coded by skilled designers are the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of the worldâ€™s visualizations instead are produced using end-user applications such as spreadsheets and business intelligence tools. While valuable, these tools often fall short of fully supporting the iterative, interactive process of data analysis. Improved tools could help a larger swath of people create effective visualizations and better understand their data.The goal of the Vega project is to promote an ecosystem of usable and interoperable visualization tools, supporting use cases ranging from exploratory data analysis to effective communication via custom visualization design.This goal has led us to develop not a singular system, but rather a stack of tools for interactive data visualization. At the foundation of this stack is the Vega visualization grammar. Similar to how SQL provides a language for expressing database queries, Vega provides a declarative language for describing interactive visualizations with primitive building blocks such as data, transforms, marks, and event streams.  On top of Vega, Vega-Lite provides a concise language for rapidly generating statistical graphics to support data analysis.  With Vega and Vega-Lite, we have built a number of graphical user interfaces including the Voyager visualization tool, which blends manual and automated chart authoring to facilitate exploratory data analysis. Tools from the Vega ecosystems have been adopted by the Jupyter/Python data science communities, Wikipedia, and leading tech companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, FitBit, and Twitter.",None,http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OL5_wmiCr1pWfMOZb3LS22O5cuz0-13CAjv8zrCFaIoelZX2Kg7sdnSu8iot2nGee42tjG00P9dqS-CJwFAhTjIJwayuKWs,nan,The Vega Visualization Tools by the UW Interactive Data Lab,2,"Declarative formats & Applications for Creating, Saving & Sharing Visualizations",javascript,typescript,react,d3.js,nan,data visualization,visualization grammar,data science,declarative language,plotting tools,https://vega.github.io/,2018,nan

The dominant programming language is still C, although more promising and most importantly more efficient results can be achieved by a well-considered use of C++. The Wiselib is an algorithms library for networked embedded devices. It contains various algorithm classes (for instance, localization or routing) that can be compiled for several platforms such as iSense or Contiki, or the sensor network simulator Shawn. It is completely written in C++, and uses templates in the same way as Boost and CGAL. This makes it possible to write generic and platform independent code that is very efficiently compiled for the various platforms. In the scope of Google Summer of Code 2012 we give interested and talented students the opportunity to solve interesting problems arising from the application of theoretical algorithms in practice on wireless sensor nodes. Projects around the Wiselib involve working with networked embedded devices, solving diverse challenges w.r.t. inter-node communication and building the groundwork for whole new classes of algorithms.

1069,nan,"Mailing List: mailto:wiselib@wiselib.org   The Wiselib is an algorithms and protocol library for networked embedded devices, such as microcontroller-based sensor nodes, Internet-of-Things-enabled devices and Android- or iOS-based mobile phones. It contains standard protocols (e.g., 6LowPAN, CoAP), algorithms (e.g., localization, routing, time synchronization, clustering), and data structures (e.g., an external-memory lists and sets, an RDF database), that can be compiled for several different platforms. The supported platforms include TinyOS and Contiki, the two major operating systems for sensor-class devices, as well as several device-specific firmwares (iSense, Feuerwhere, TriSOS, etc). The two major handheld OS (Android and iOS) are supported as well. The Wiselib is written in C++. It uses templates and template specialization in the same way as Boost, CGAL, and the STL. This makes it possible to write generic and platform-independent code that is very efficiently compiled for the various platforms. The motivating issue behind the Wiselib is the severe fragmentation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. For sensor nodes, TinyOS dominates the US, and Contiki Europe, hindering exchange of ideas and code. Many IoT scenarios (say, Smart Cities where people can use their handheld to interact with local city services) require connectivity between mobile phones, infrastructure devices, and battery-powered sensors and actors. This requires either programming against a truly platform-independent API (such as the Wiselib), or porting and maintaining code for 5-10 completely different platforms. We provide easy-to-use interfaces to the OS, which simplifies the development process and decreases the need for dealing with low-level functionality of specific hardware platforms. Algorithms can even be run in a simulation environment first (for debugging purposes, for example), and then compiled for real hardware platforms without changing a single line of algorithm code. Algorithms can be directly integrated in applications. For example, when developing an application for iSense that collects sensor data values, a Wiselib routing algorithm can be used to route the data to a sink.",nan,nan,http://www.wiselib.org/gsoc/,The Wiselib,6,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2013,https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2013/orgs/wiselib/logo-200.png

The research uses data from satellites launched by NASA, ESA (European Space Agency) and JAXA (the Japanese space agency), among others. The current project will help astrophysicists to make significant advancements in the understanding of black holes; it will set the standard of timing analysis techniques, help collaborations and lower the entrance barrier for researchers and students to join this field.More recently, the use of novel analysis techniques brought outstanding advancements. New ideas about how to analyze astronomy data has started what is now called â€œthe spectral-timing revolutionâ€ù leading to a hotbed of new developments.One of the obstacles of the several fast-moving research groups in this field is the lack of shared, publicly available tools for analysis. Many individual tools and libraries exist, and some are even publicly available, but what is lacking is a coherent set for a complete analysis. Moreover, the lack of any GUI makes the tools (more) difficult to use. This situation hinders collaboration and mobility of researchers between groups. Most importantly, it is an entrance barrier that forbids other researchers and students to join the field and build momentum in this exciting period of new discoveries.We will build a timing analysis framework, integrating and expanding our Python projects for specialized astronomy tools Stingray and MaLTPyNT, also making use of existing tools like Astropy, Sherpa, SciPy and Carma.",FFFFFF,http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/68Hw4cms8bhh17Ya-61UeLV_vNE3M-mrqgLCsHX3MUlQbHdx6BaeSbS1cxlcR3ajsXdmwgAtfAN46eKUxiUYyUCEMhlgN1w,nan,Timelab Technologies Ltd.,3,We help scientists understanding information in time-series,python,javascript,nan,nan,nan,astronomy,algorithm prototyping/visualization,mathematics,time series,nan,http://www.timelabtechnologies.com/,2016,nan

It is open source, cross-platform, modular, and allows you to deal with languages that use special writing systems (e.g. Arabic and many Asian languages). Some of its functional features stem from its resources: precision, completeness, and ability to handle multi-word units, including through the use of dictionaries and local grammars.The dictionaries specify the simple and multi-word units of a language together with their lemmas and a set of grammatical (semantic and inflectional) codes. The availability of these dictionaries is a major advantage compared to the usual utilities for pattern searching: the information they contain can be used for searching and matching, thus describing large classes of words using very simple patterns. The dictionaries are presented in a specific formalism called DELA, internally compiled into a minimal finite state automata, and were constructed by teams of linguists from different countries for several languages: French, English, Greek, Italian, Spanish, German, Arabic, Thai, Korean, Polish, Norwegian, Portuguese.The grammars are representations of linguistic phenomena on the basis of recursive transition networks (RTN), a formalism closely related to FST. Numerous studies have shown the adequacy of automata for linguistic problems at all descriptive levels from morphology and syntax to phonetic issues. Grammars created with Unitex/GramLab carry this approach further by using a formalism even more powerful than automata. They are represented as graphs that the user can easily create and update using a visual integrated development environment which is an essential part of the platform.",nan,http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eRTNtDGJfmj06lZRbxDWDv1KHDjkbSnrDBZse3rWYuDNDPLNc7jyebqWSmK1O_yl_gLmeQOInzBjVrV3AaAty2Psi16zB6M,nan,Unitex/GramLab,2,"Unitex/GramLab is an open source, multilingual corpus processing suite",java,c++,nan,nan,nan,natural language processing,local grammars,finite state automata,corpus annotation,multilingual language resources,http://unitexgramlab.org,2016,nan

Specifically, Universal Subtitles is a... Javascript Widget for Collaborative Subtitling We've built a JS widget for creating and playing subtitles that you can embed in any page. This lets people transcribe videos, sync subtitles, and submit translations to our site. It also lets you watch the subtitles in any page. It works with Youtube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Blip, Flowplayer, JW Player and all HTML5 video (h264 and WebM) for now.Â  The widget is built using Google Closure. Collaborative Subtitling Site We've made a subtitle community site (in Django, available under the AGPL) that stores the subtitles and provides a place to watch videos and collaborate. You can download subtitles in any format, view revision history for subtitles, and follow videos (or specific subtitle sets) to receive notifications of new changes.Â  You can also comment on subs, and message other users.Â  Check it out: universalsubtitles.org Non-profit, mission-driven projectÂ  to strengthen bottom-up media We want to make it easy for online video made by individuals and small organizations to get professional quality subtitles.Â  We believe we can eliminate language and accessibility barriers to any popular web video. The project is run by the nonprofit Participatory Culture Foundation, and has received support from Mozilla, the MacArthur Foundation, and others. Over 15,000 videos have been submitted to the site, and the New York Times recently used our subtitling widget in their middle east coverage (check it out). Popular videos for other free and open source projects like Mozilla and Drupal have received volunteer translations into dozens of languages (like this Drupal 7 video).

Ushahidi's roots are in the collaboration of Kenyan citizen journalists during a time of crisis. The website was used to map incidents of violence and peace efforts throughout the country based on reports submitted via the web and mobile phone. This initial deployment of Ushahidi had 45,000 users in Kenya, and was the catalyst for us realizing there was a need for a platform based on it, which could be use by others around the world.  Since then we have grown from an ad hoc group of volunteers to a focused organization. The team is comprised of individuals with a wide span of experience ranging from human rights work to software development. We have also built a strong team of volunteer developers in primarily in Africa, but also Europe and the U.S. Â   ABOUT THE PROJECT Â  Swiftriver is a free and open source software platform that uses a combination of algorithms and crowdsourced interaction to validate and filter news. It is an open source effort by many contributing people and organizations including Meedan, Appfrica, GeoCommons and Ushahidi.  User-generated content is becoming an increasingly important source of information during emergency events while traditional media continues to play a pivotal role in documenting events as they unfold. These trends are expected to continue well into the future. The challenge, then, becomes filtering this growing torrent of information. There is an apparent tradeoff between crowdsourcing (opening the floodgates) and validation (the filter). One of the strengths of crowdsourcing is the ability to collect a high volume of information from highly diverse channels like Twitter, email, news sites, blogs, and SMS.  Swift acts as the verifying filter for these different channels and is possible precisely because of the volume of information available from these sources. The more information generated, the more the community interacts with it, and the easier it becomes to identify mutually trusted sources.",nan,nan,http://swift.ushahidi.com/extend/ideas/,Ushahidi,3,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2010,nan

For  more information, take a look here. YafaRay (Yet Another Free Raytracer) is a FOSS raytracing engine. Raytracing is a rendering technique for generating realistic images by tracing the path of light through a 3D scene. A render engine consists of a ""faceless"" computer program that interacts with a host 3D application to provide raytracing capabilities on demand. The YafaRay engine is intended as a free open source alternative to known proprietary engines such as Vray or MentalRay.   The YafaRay project was started in 2001 by Alejandro Conty EstÃ©vez. By general request from the Blender Community, YafaRay was added as a Blender plugin in August 2004. YafaRay was rewritten from scratch in 2006 by Mathias Wein to allow for new modern features.  The YafaRay project has become through the years the first and most popular GPL raytracer and an important reference for the Blender Community, averaging 10.000 downloads and 40.000 unique visitors a month in 2009. A picture is worth a thousand words.

411,Science and Medicine,"Why Open Science?Science is only at its finest when its fruits are accessible to anyone in the world, when the data is publicly available to support the claims in the paper, and when the software is treated as first-class citizen in the scientific publishing, so that the results can be analyzed, reproduced and refined by anyone, today and 5, 10 or 100 years in the future. Principles of Open Science are at the core of the scientific method.Most of the scholarly communication today is done as it was a hundred years ago. The data supporting the claims in the paper can be difficult to acquire or even impossible to find, software used to produce the results is a collection of scripts rotting-away on a laptop or a USB stick, while the paper itself, after it's been published, is kept behind a publisher's paywall, and is not easily accessible to everyone. The scientific community has yet to fully appreciate the lessons taught by the FOSS movement, and Zenodo[1] was built to make Open Science a reality for everyone.What is Zenodo?Zenodo is an open and free digital archive, allowing all researchers from around the world to publish their papers, data and software, which then can be cited, accessed, analyzed and reproduced by anyone. Zenodo is built by the researchers and software engineers at CERN in collaboration with OpenAIRE, sharing passion for Open Source and Open Science. Zenodo is both a free and public service, as well as Free and Open Source Software, based on Invenio - a general purpose digital library platform, and also a FOSS developed and used by CERN as well as other institutions worldwide. By contributing to Zenodo you will also contribute to Invenio, so not only will you aid Open Science, but also many other scientific institutes and academic libraries around the world![1] The name, Zenodo, is derived from Zenodotus, the first librarian of the Ancient Library of Alexandria and father of the first recorded use of metadata, a landmark in library history.",None,http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t18I4Tabm3yIeT595HG9pbjrqUelCzLjUoWehqSCdBmLS9uk7vgPCJRQoBJRFArkA_pbyj-LZisqDm-IjCbLfKgT0Ek2UA,nan,Zenodo,2,A free and open digital archive for the long-tail of science.,python,postgresql,flask,angularjs,elasticsearch,content management,web,open science,digital library,machine learning,https://zenodo.org,2017,nan

It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other group chat tools designed to help teams (whether open source projects or companies) collaborate effectively. Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and much more -- essentially everything you might want.Unlike Slack, itâ€™s open source and has a welcoming community of over 400 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.Zulip is known for its extensive developer documentation (100,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application.  Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of a significant component of Zulip by the end of the program.As an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers.

Some of the many possible payloads are: a Linux kernel, FILO, GRUB2, OpenBIOS, Open Firmware, SmartFirmware, GNUFI (UEFI), Etherboot, SeaBIOS (for booting Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, NetBSD and Linux), ADLO (for booting Windows 2000 and OpenBSD), Plan 9, or memtest86. The initial motivation for the project was maintenance of large clusters, but unsurprisingly, interest and contributions have come from people with varying backgrounds. The latest version of coreboot can be used in a wide variety of scenarios including clusters, embedded systems, desktop PCs, servers, and more. Why do we need coreboot for cluster maintainance?  Current PCs used as cluster nodes depend on a vendor-supplied BIOS for booting. The BIOS in turn relies on inherently unreliable devices such as floppy disks and hard drives to boot the operating system. In addition, current BIOS software is unable to accommodate non-standard hardware making it difficult to support experimental work. The BIOS is slow and often erroneous and redundant and, most importantly, maintenance is a nightmare. Imagine walking around with a keyboard and monitor to every one of the 1024 nodes in a cluster to change one BIOS setting. coreboot with Linux as a payload (other payloads are possible!) decompresses the Linux kernel straight out of Flash and essentially requires no moving parts (other than maybe a fan). It does a minimal amount of hardware initialization before jumping to the kernel start and lets Linux do the rest. As a result, it is much faster (current record 3 seconds), which has sparked interest in the consumer electronics community as well. Moreover, updates can be performed over the network.  Using a real operating system to boot another operating system provides much greater flexibility than using a simple netboot program or the BIOS. Because Linux is the boot mechanism, it can boot over standard Ethernet or over other interconnects such as Myrinet, Quadrics, or SCI. It can use SSH connections to load the kernel, or it can use the InterMezzo caching file system or traditional NFS. Cluster nodes can be as simple as they need to be â€“ perhaps as simple as a CPU and memory, no disk, no floppy, and no file system. The nodes will be much less autonomous thus making them easier to maintain. Some aspects of DRM are not travelling well with the idea of a free computer system. As many computer magazines already pointed out, there may be future restrictions imposed by BIOSes, that a customer is little aware of before purchase and might not harmonize with the idea of freedom and/or security in some cases.",nan,nan,http://www.coreboot.org/GSoC,coreboot,3,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2009,nan
1285,nan,"Mailing List: https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/darktable-users   darktable is a free virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers. It manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view them through a zoomable lighttable. It also enables you to develop raw images and enhance them. This project tries to fill the gap between the many excellent existing free raw converters and image management tools (such as UFRaw or F-Spot). All editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image buffers for display. The full image is only converted during export. The frontend is written in gtk+/cairo, the database uses sqlite3, raw image loading is done using rawspeed and libraw as fallback, high-dynamic range, and standard image formats such as jpeg are also supported. The core operates completely on floating point values, so darktable can not only be used for photography but also for scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic range). Darktable features parts of its pipeline in OpenCL for fast processing. The core is very small, and every possible task is outsourced to loadable modules, such as image format for export, light table plugins as the collection interface, and raw pixel processing plugins. We are quickly approaching the 150k lines of code (see http://www.ohloh.net/p/darktable/analyses/latest), with three main developers and about 19 active contributors (who submitted more than one patch since release-0.7.1).

It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.The proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).",nan,http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cadHt100pr7Uno6uq-GB-K4UoH73xRB7ml_wQmMkrF-rlQ_tLSb4LnO3bj1enxnBrSB5D3k-SCP5dT2G2gh04u9lC1LzYA,nan,gnss-sdr,3,GNSS-SDR is an open source Global Navigation Satellite Systems software receiver,c/c++,c++11,c++14,gnss,nan,communications,geolocation,navigation,software defined radio,nan,http://www.gnss-sdr.org,2016,nan

We bring together a passionate community of developers and a growing base of commercial participants (Delphix, Joyent, Nexenta, OmniTI, and others).illumos is the successor to Sun Microsystems' OpenSolaris project. Our culture draws heavily on the qualities that distinguished Sun engineering culture: systems engineering (component, interaction, and interface design with a strong commitment to minimalism), architectural coherence (design cooperation across subsystems), measurement-driven development (strong visibility tools, mature methodologies for their use, embedding both thoroughly in the development process). We have adapted it to work beyond the framework of a single corporate entity via federated efforts of individuals and companies with distinct interests in the technology (cloud infrastructure, storage systems, application servers, and others), sharing an interest in commodity hardware and production-driven innovation.illumos features an unparalleled combination of technologies, including the resilient ZFS storage system, production-safe dynamic tracing (DTrace), FMA predictive self-healing, the Service Management Framework for persistent process and boot management, zones for lightweight isolation and virtualisation, the KVM hypervisor for full system virtualisation, Crossbow for virtualised networks, a high-performance kernel CIFS/SMB client and server, boot environments for safe upgrades, and the MDB kernel and application debugger. All of these subsystems are actively developed by the illumos project.

202,Programming Languages and Development Tools,"webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.OverviewCurrently in the web, modules are not fully adopted, and therefore we need tooling to help compile your module code into something that will work in the browser. webpack champions this by not only supporting CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS module systems, but also ECMAScript Modules (ESM).What makes webpack unique?Extensibility webpack is built using an extensible event-driven architecture. This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.Focused around Web Performance webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as ""code splitting"". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.Built in JavaScript webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve.Used at Scale webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.Community Owned webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders.
