[{"category": "Science and Medicine", "description": "The 3D Toolkit is a collection of programs that allow working with 3D point cloud data. The tools include a powerful and efficient 3D point cloud viewer called \"show\" which is able to open point clouds containing millions of points even on older graphics cards while still providing high frame rates. It provides bindings for ROS, the Robotic Operating System and for Python, the programming language. Most of the functionality of 3DTK is provided in the form of \"tools\", hence the name which are executed on the command line. These tools are able to carry out operations like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), plane detection, transformations, surface normal computation, feature detection and extraction, collision detection and dynamic object removal. We support Linux, Windows and MacOS. 3DTK contains the implementation of several complex algorithms like multiple SLAM and ICP implementations as well as several data structures like k-d trees, octrees, sphere quadtrees and voxel grids. The software is home of the implementation of algorithms from several high impact research papers. While the Point Cloud Library (PCL) might be dead, 3DTK is alive and actively maintained by an international team of skilled researchers from all over the world, ranging from Europe to China.

Linux XIA, the native implementation of XIA in the Linux kernel, became a project member of Software Freedom Conservancy in 2016.\nPranav Goswami, one of our previous students, has summarized the growth experience that GSoC has brought to him and other of our students in the following testimonial:\n\u201cWorking in GSoC as a student (2015) and then as a mentor (2017) for Linux XIA has been rewarding in many aspects and, throughout this journey, I have grown a lot and learned a lot.  Starting out as a student, I was guided very proficiently by Michel, Qiaobin, John, and Cody throughout the program. This, in turn, boosted my confidence and improved my communication as well as coding standard. It also gave me in-depth knowledge about the kernel development and using present technologies to build future ideas. Linux XIA gives ample opportunities to improve and take charge in the process. After successfully completing the program the team trusted me to take a more challenging role as a mentor. Their belief motivated me to work harder and deliver more to my mentees. This experience has helped me develop my overall profile. As a GSoC organization, I couldn't have asked for more.

Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as int count = \"hello\";.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 new type systems, and other people have created many more.\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.

It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\nFor Users\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\nFor Developers\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind.

Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday.\nDBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL).

It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.\nIn brief, a software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware. The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!\nYou can use GNU Radio to write applications to receive and transmit data with radio hardware, or to create entirely simulation-based applications. GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronisation elements, equalizers, demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other types of blocks which are typically found in signal processing systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.\nGNU Radio applications can be written in either C++ or Python programming language, while the performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point extensions where available.

This engine provides comprehensive models for the human physiology. Both API are very close to each other: C++, Cmake, a core library with optional plugins. The integration will be helped with two mentors: one from the SOFA community and another one from the Pulse community.This project will therefore bring a new open-source technology to drive medical research, and innovation.\n2.

Bitmask provides a local proxy that a standard email client can connect to, and allows for easy one-click Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.\nThe LEAP email system has several security advantages over typical encryption applications: if not already encrypted, incoming email is encrypted so that only the recipient can read it; email is always stored client-encrypted, both locally and when synchronized with the server; all message relay among service providers is required to be encrypted when possible; and public keys are automatically discovered and validated. In short, the Bitmask app offers full end-to-end encryption, quietly handling the complexities of public key encryption and allowing for backward compatibility with legacy email when necessary.

It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.\nMatrix.org defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, Clients, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.\nWhat is Matrix\u2019s Mission?\nMatrix\u2019s initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications: letting users message and call each other without having to care what app the other user is on - making it as easy as sending an email.\nThe longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP messaging and data synchronisation system for the whole web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other securely, and empowering users to own and control their data and select the services and vendors they want to use.\nWhat does this mean for users?\nThe aim is to provide an analogous ecosystem to email - one where you can communicate with pretty much anyone, without caring what app or server they are using, using whichever app & server you chose to use, and use a neutral identity system like an e-mail address or phone number to discover people to talk to.\nHow is Matrix currently being used?\nLots of different clients have already been written by the community, as well as several bridges to existing services (IRC, Slack, libpurple etc). In fact, a user visiting #matrix on freenode might be communicating with Gitter or Slack users via Matrix - without even realising it!\nRecent work on Matrix includes E2E encryption (see FOSDEM 2017 talks below), embeddable widgets, Communities and Dendrite!\n\nEncrypting Matrix\nThe future of decentralised communication", "logo": {"image_bg_color": "ffffff", "image_url": "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XhZGpIxn6lFSbrK03LU1Xj5vC_ew3CCOtmxkETcbaMdNa4zxYuEv4FYkrCi9_Zc1CxWATc2sz5GjUOWD8nIPhUzdaD8Lql8"}, "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": null, "name": "Matrix.org", "num_projects": 2, "tagline": "An ambitious open ecosystem for decentralised, encrypted communication.", "technologies": ["golang", "ios", " android", " python", "react"], "topics": ["real time communications", "team chat", "voip", "instant messaging", "decentralization"], "website": "https://matrix.org", "year": 2018},{"category": "Data and Databases", "description": "The MetaBrainz Foundation is a non-profit that believes in free, open access to data.

The main objective of the project, called ProvinciaWiFi (later renamed WiFi Metropolitano), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing digital divide by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium CASPUR (later merged in the CINECA consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the CINECA consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites.\nThe methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such. \u2028This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to WiFi Metropolitano: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy \u2013 typical of open projects \u2013 anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n\u2028The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 wifi controller and different NetJSON implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.", "logo": {"image_bg_color": "None", "image_url": "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2DAhgc297DrrN_jKFnmhmFil8TvZ8928ohyVdD2LJZupy1CslQ8qRQn-XOTL24hfDMKz1sYFHOp0rnjzA6n1Ot4mGRD_CO0"}, "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": null, "name": "OpenWISP", "num_projects": 2, "tagline": "Open Source solution to build and manage wifi networks", "technologies": ["python", "django", "javascript", "openwrt", "linux"], "topics": ["wifi", "mesh-networks", "wireless", "networking", "web development"], "website": "http://openwisp.org", "year": 2018},{"category": "Social / Communications", "description": "The Open Event Project offers event managers a platform to organize all kinds of events including concerts, conferences, summits and regular meetups.

PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models.\nTransparency, repeatability, accessibility\nPEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.\nHigh functionality and performance\nIn addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual machine that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters.", "logo": {"image_bg_color": "None", "image_url": "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8mn2eDvDnb76x_0k5XYgQ4mhgTOY5He9wljc-frxmIgdIo7AcIkeFN5MxOPl0xDBvww7Iba5aWrakJO6_HpaAK_t3AOmYPk"}, "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": null, "name": "PEcAn Project", "num_projects": 1, "tagline": "Develop accessible tools for reproducible ecosystem modeling and forecasting", "technologies": [" javascript", "postgresql", " php", "c", "r"], "topics": [" scientific visualization", " data science", " climate science", "ecosystem models", "ecological forecasting"], "website": "http://pecanproject.org", "year": 2018},{"category": "Operating Systems", "description": "The Performance Co-Pilot is a toolkit designed for monitoring and managing system-level performance.

This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.\nFocused around Web Performance webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.\nBuilt in JavaScript webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS.

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.\nCore features\nNative Parallelism\nChapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.\nData and Task Locality\nWhen working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.\nMultiresolution Philosophy\nChapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.\nModern Language Features\nChapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.\nInteroperability\nExisting code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.", "logo": {"image_bg_color": "None", "image_url": "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/s4JuBTa-ubZeh2Ia905LRd6y0vUdndUgfHF3GEHwUAs-4D_F-Vvr2iPkZWd6Ml8gTtUMasmHOQ4myPU99LOIOFIz6TxHbSw"}, "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": null, "name": "Chapel", "num_projects": 3, "tagline": "a Productive Parallel Programming Language", "technologies": ["chapel", "python", "high performance computing", "c", "c++"], "topics": ["programming languages", "compilers", "high performance computing", "distributed computing", "parallel computing"], "website": "http://chapel-lang.org", "year": 2017},{"category": "Programming Languages and Development Tools", "description": "We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.\nWe have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the\nChecker Framework.\nThe Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time,\nbefore they escape to production.

Pluggable type-checking replaces a\nprogramming language's built-in type system with a more powerful,\nexpressive one.\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as int count =\n\"hello\";.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null\npointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private\ninformation, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, and\nso forth.\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type\nsystem and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system\nis not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives\na guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.\nEven though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the\nstandard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into\ntheir workflow.

It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code,  find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.\nAll controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\nFor Users\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool.\nBesides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\nFor Developers\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\nFor Newcomers\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.", "logo": {"image_bg_color": "ffffff", "image_url": "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7r3cwED-WmWH-vVOzeGYA9MF93nUncWsKrzGRwFbVqhVs9Omb-Pnns1q1UTvttLZwpZwJ7yTE87EEJ8V56B4Wkz0-cw_BGJj"}, "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": null, "name": "coala", "num_projects": 9, "tagline": "Linting and Fixing Code for All Languages", "technologies": ["python"], "topics": ["code analysis"], "website": "https://coala.io", "year": 2017},{"category": "Science and Medicine", "description": "Our group works at the interface of computer science, biology, and mathematics by applying computational approaches to the seas of data in biomedical research.

Such hardware designs can for example be single \"IP blocks\" or entire system-on-chip (SoC). Our vision is that there will be multiple open source chips in the next years. Our main effort is our community hub website LibreCores.org.\nBeside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.\nWith those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware. We are open to proposals that help us getting in the direction of \"open source chips\". Please find a list of a few ideas, and we highly encourage you to think beyond that.\nGoogle Summer of Code students are invited to present and demonstrate their projects at our annual conference with 100-200 attendants, which is held in Hebden Bridge, UK, on September 8-10.", "logo": {"image_bg_color": "None", "image_url": "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xR8AezbubAAiM5GsN0dbB-hrJfmsavDN20GhILipASprUBKl62Hwk-tijvzvwx2hEI_RiP0mKyd034GMRcji8LRwtrv7J88K"}, "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": null, "name": "Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation", "num_projects": 4, "tagline": "Umbrella for various projects around open source hardware and tools", "technologies": ["verilog", "c", "vhdl", "python"], "topics": ["hardware", "eda tools", "web"], "website": "http://fossi-foundation.org/", "year": 2017},{"category": "Operating Systems", "description": "FreeBSD is an advanced operating system for modern server, desktop, and embedded computer platforms.

Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development.

Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end.

In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium CASPUR (later merged in the CINECA consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the CINECA consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites.\nThe methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such. \u2028This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to WiFi Metropolitano: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy \u2013 typical of open projects \u2013 anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n\u2028The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 wifi controller and different NetJSON implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.", "logo": {"image_bg_color": "333", "image_url": "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--u1VxOKOF1MV64kY2wRdG6g1_wlidSOXAHqjigTogQ0RQdNXKnXXu8tO5kAzSX1te5I3QZk4wZobbMWbsJfOAXk8m5T8H0"}, "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": null, "name": "OpenWISP", "num_projects": 5, "tagline": "Open Source solution to build and manage wifi networks", "technologies": ["python", "django", "javascript", "openwrt", "raspberry pi"], "topics": ["networking", "wireless", "configuration management", "telecommunications", "web"], "website": "http://openwisp.org", "year": 2017},{"category": "Web", "description": "Why Oppia?\nProviding personalized tutoring to every single person in the world. This is a long-term aspiration for Oppia, the tool which allows users to collaboratively create interactive tutorial experiences online.\nInteractive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called explorations. Learners (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations are dynamic and interactive, meaning there are multiple paths through the exploration depending on the answers the learner submits (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor; an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make.\nCommunity-driven content creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of creators (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate easily creating targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners).

The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30).

Ideally, upstream component developers begin the process by supplying SPDX flies as part of their downloads. Users of those components therefore have a starting point for the SPDX files they create for their \"customers,\" and so on. If everything is working properly, the provenance of each piece of code is researched and documented only once during its journey through a supply chain, and that information is passed on in parallel with the code in the SPDX format.\nExecution\nDevelopment of SPDX is run somewhat like an open source project: Those that participate influence. Decisions tend to be made by consensus. The spec itself is writen by a technical team with input and support from business and legal teams. Although much of the the initial focus was on Linux and the project is under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, the strategy from the outset has been much broader to be applicable to anything open source. To accommodate a range of needs, SPDX can be implemented in XML or tag-value formats.\nThe SPDX \"IP\" is all housed on this site.

Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.\nCore features\nNative Parallelism\nChapel supports parallelism at the language level.  For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body.  These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.\nData and Task Locality\nWhen working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance.  Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.\nMultiresolution Philosophy\nChapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.\nModern Language Features\nChapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.\nInteroperability\nExisting code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.", "logo": {"image_bg_color": "None", "image_url": "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YGskaN0p1RQT1sllLkLpNhv7WyEWOmzH8tvv91s-hHyJI8oB-A8Zis-gIPOQSKJtbOX_fbe4kOBRi3kG8jRvBS84rWS3OTU"}, "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": null, "name": "Chapel", "num_projects": 2, "tagline": "a Productive Parallel Programming Language", "technologies": ["python", "chapel", "c", "c++", "high performance computing"], "topics": ["programming languages", "compilers", "high performance computing", "distributed computing", "parallel computing"], "website": "http://chapel.cray.com", "year": 2016},{"category": "Social / Communications", "description": "CiviCRM is the CRM of several Google Summer of Code mentoring organizations from previous years including CERN, Creative Commons, Drupal Association, and Electronic Frontier Foundation.

But their background differs (Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics) as well as their application area (flow through porous media, linear elasticity, computational fluid dynamics, electro-magnetism, \u2026).\nHistory\nDUNE started with an inaugurating meeting in February 2002. People from different German research groups of Universities in Bonn, Freiburg, and Heidelberg shared a common interest: developing an clean, slim, and modern open source framework for the parallel solution of PDEs which would allow reusing existent legacy software via a common interface based on generic programming techniques.\nDUNE's main principles\n\nSeparation of data structures and algorithms by abstract interfaces. This provides more functionality with less code and ensures maintainability and extendability of the framework.\nStatic polymorphism allows the compiler to do more optimizations, in particular function inlining, which in turn allows the interface to have very small functions without a severe performance penalty.", "logo": {"image_bg_color": "None", "image_url": "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/l2vFuvmUfWzb-nh0v58xX3NL6DC_oYaV6ENmgJbTn4r5sqSHqRJCp5ixF0qreW5tWReNLjX4qWRx1h_6ZXOWMOS6FKzLhg"}, "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": null, "name": "Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment (DUNE)", "num_projects": 2, "tagline": "DUNE is a modular toolbox for solving PDEs with grid-based methods.", "technologies": ["c++", "python", "cmake"], "topics": ["partial differential equations", "physics", "mathematics", "high performance computing", "scientific computing"], "website": "https://www.dune-project.org", "year": 2016},{"category": "", "description": "Django is a high-level Python Web framework originally developed at the Lawrence-Journal World.

Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.\nIt's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.\nThe Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free.\nThe Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together.

Beside that \"uncore\" hardware components are important to build a System-on-Chip. The focus of the FOSSi Foundation is therefore not on a single processor core, but we work on advancing the entire Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) community. Our main ambition goes into building a community hub: LibreCores.org. We currently bring it forward to become the main resource to find open source hardware components and publish such components and their ecosystem.\nBeside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.\nWith those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware.

The methods for solving these different tasks can be very different and highly targeted for that special object type. Because of this reason we have implementation of crude detection/recognition algorithms scattered over different places without any common standard. Even with the availability of dedicated computer vision libraries like OpenCV/PCL, implementation of a simple object detection application based on the existing techniques is not a trivial task as it should be.\nThus, the purpose of this library is to contribute in this field and make available the existing solution in this direction in a common, very structured, and a very user-friendly APIs.

In the long term, we aspire to provide personalized tutoring to every single person in the world.\nInteractive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called explorations. Learners (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations are dynamic and interactive, meaning there are multiple paths through the exploration depending on the answers the learner submits (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor; an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.\nCommunity-driven content creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of creators (users who create explorations). Oppia provides tools that enable teachers, bloggers, professors and enthusiasts to create new explorations without needing to know how to code. Our exploration editor helps creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, and allows the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners).

The framework has ports done to the following targets:\n\nLinux\nZephyr OS\nRIOT OS\n(Partially) Contiki OS\n\nBy writing a Soletta application, it's a matter of parametrising specific OS values, like GPIO pin numbers and such (Soletta already eases that task) and, with a makefile that builds with the respective toolchains/SDKs, the same application would be functional for all supported targets.\nOne of the ways Soletta exposes of writing applications is by flow-based programming (FBP), which allows the programmer to express business logic as a directional graph of nodes connected to type-specific ports.\nThe connected node ports will exchange information packets (IP) that will be used to run the flow. The packet can be either empty, used just to trigger an action, or carry a value such as booleans, integers, floats and even complex data types such as blobs. Ports can decide if the packets they produce will be queued or replaced if they were not consumed by target ports when a new packet is to be produced.\nFor those used to traditional object oriented programming (OOP) it's like using the observer pattern on source nodes, calling the associated data getter which is then forwarded to target nodes by calling their setter.

These resources consist of language-processing dictionaries and grammars provided by contributors from several countries. Unitex/GramLab is a platform in which you can put linguistic resources, manage them and use them. It is open source, cross-platform, modular, and allows you to deal with languages that use special writing systems (e.g. Arabic and many Asian languages). Some of its functional features stem from its resources: precision, completeness, and ability to handle multi-word units, including through the use of dictionaries and local grammars.\nThe dictionaries specify the simple and multi-word units of a language together with their lemmas and a set of grammatical (semantic and inflectional) codes. The availability of these dictionaries is a major advantage compared to the usual utilities for pattern searching: the information they contain can be used for searching and matching, thus describing large classes of words using very simple patterns. The dictionaries are presented in a specific formalism called DELA, internally compiled into a minimal finite state automata, and were constructed by teams of linguists from different countries for several languages: French, English, Greek, Italian, Spanish, German, Arabic, Thai, Korean, Polish, Norwegian, Portuguese.\nThe grammars are representations of linguistic phenomena on the basis of recursive transition networks (RTN), a formalism closely related to FST. Numerous studies have shown the adequacy of automata for linguistic problems at all descriptive levels from morphology and syntax to phonetic issues. Grammars created with Unitex/GramLab carry this approach further by using a formalism even more powerful than automata.

CERN is one of the world\u2019s largest and most exciting centers for fundamental physics research. Experiments at CERN have probed the fundamental nature of matter and the forces which affect it. CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web (http://info.cern.ch), invented by Tim Berners-Lee. The SFT group's efforts, like most of CERN's current activities, are directed towards the world\u2019s highest-energy elementary particle accelerator - the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html) and its experiments. There are four large experiments at the LHC (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb) which seek to expand the frontiers of knowledge and complete our understanding of the constituents of matter and their interactions, of the conditions in the first instants after the Big Bang and of the differences between matter and anti-matter. During 2012, ATLAS and CMS announced the discovery of a new boson, which has been confirmed recently to have the properties of a Higgs boson - similar to the one required by the Standard Model of Particle Physics. NOTE: The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge. Operating the LHC and running each experiment requires a large amount of software. A large part of this software is common and open source. The open source software spans the range from system software to more specialized physics-oriented tools and toolkits. The projects to which students can contribute span several software projects: SixTrack is a simulation tool for the trajectory of high energy particles in accelerators. It has been used in the design and optimization of the LHC and is now being used to design the upgrade that will be installed in the next decade, the High-Luminsity LHC (HL-LHC). Sixtrack has been adapted to take advantage of large scale volunteer computing resources provided by the LHC@Home project. It has been engineered to give the exact same results after millions of operations on several, very different computer platforms. The ROOT \u00a0(http://root.cern.ch/) software framework is used to handle, store and analyze the data of all LHC experiments. The experiments store both their raw data and intermediate, processed results using ROOT, as it offers an open source format and is very compact. Having the data defined as a set of objects, it is possible to get access separately to particular attributes of the selected objects, without touching the remaining attributes. ROOT includes many tools for analysis of data, from histogramming methods in an arbitrary number of dimensions, curve fitting, function evaluation, minimization, graphics and visualization. It includes also a built-in C++ interpreter the command language which is used as a scripting, or macro language. Cling is a new C++11 standard-compliant interpreter, an interpreter built on top of Clang (www.clang.llvm.org) and LLVM (www.llvm.org) compiler infrastructure. Cling is being developed at CERN as a standalone project. It is also being integrated into ROOT, giving access to a C++11 standards compliant interpreter. ROOT is an open system that can be dynamically extended by linking external libraries. This makes ROOT a premier platform on which to build data acquisition, simulation and data analysis systems. The Geant4 toolkit (http://cern.ch/geant4) is a key component of the common physics software. It simulates the interactions of radiation with material in any setup, including the detectors of the LHC or other High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. There are many diverse uses in other fields: assessing the effects of radiation on the electronics of satellites and designing improved medical detectors with specialized applications such as the Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission GATE (http://www.opengatecollaboration.org). LHC experiments use Geant4 to compare the signatures of events from new physics (such as the Higgs boson and particles which are candidates for dark matter) to the signatures of events coming from known interactions which could mimic them. Geant4 is created, developed and maintained by the Geant4 collaboration (http://geant4.org) of over 100 physicists and engineers from around the world from Europe (CERN, IN2P3/France, INFN/Italy), US (Fermilab, SLAC), Japan (KEK), Canada (Triumf), Russia (Lebedev) as well as many universities. A key area of current research are extension to utilize current and emerging computer architectures. One of these efforts is the Geant Vector Prototype project, which aims to demonstrate improved performance on the latest CPU and accelerator hardware. IgProf (https://igprof.org) is a lightweight performance profiling and analysis tool. It can be run in one of three modes: as a performance profiler, as a memory profiler, or in instrumentation mode. When used as a performance profiler it provides statistical sampling based performance profiles of the application. In the memory profiling mode it can be used to obtain information about the total number of dynamic memory allocations, profiles of the ``live'' memory allocations in the heap at any given time and information about memory leaks. The memory profiling is particularly important for C/C++ programs, where large amounts of dynamic memory allocation can affect performance and where very complex memory footprints need to be understood. In nearly all cases no code changes are needed to obtain profiles. The CERN Virtual Machine (CernVM, http://cernvm.cern.ch) is a project to investigate how virtualization technologies can be used to improve and simplify the daily interaction of physicists with experiment software frameworks and the Grid infrastructure. CernVM maintains a Virtual Software Appliance designed to provide a complete and portable environment for developing and running LHC data analysis applications on any end user computer (laptop, desktop) as well as on the Grid and on Clouds.", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2015/orgs/cernsft/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://ph-dep-sft.web.cern.ch/article/175948", "name": "CERN SFT", "num_projects": 14, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2015},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: http://cesiumjs.org/forum.html\n   The Cesium community develops an open-source JavaScript library for creating 3D globes and 2D maps in a web browser without a plugin.

Unfortunately scaling existing computer vision algorithms to large datasets leaves researchers repeatedly solving the same algorithmic and infrastructural problems. Our goal is to democratize computer vision; one should not have to be a computer vision, big data and distributed computing expert to have access to state-of-the-art distributed computer vision algorithms. We provide access to state-of-art distributed computer vision algorithms as a cloud service through Web Interface & APIs. Researchers, Students and Developers will be able to access these distributed computer vision algorithms and the computation power through small number of click and minimal lines of code.\u00a0 A recent World Economic Form report and a New York Times article declared data to be a new class of economic asset, like currency or gold. Visual content is arguably the fastest growing data on the web. Photo-sharing websites like Flickr and Facebook now host more than 6 and 90 Billion photos (respectively). Besides consumer data, diverse scientific communities (Civil & Aerospace Engineering, Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, and Astrophysics, etc) are also beginning to generate massive archives of visual content, without necessarily the expertise or tools to analyze them.We are building CloudCV, an ambitious system that will provide access to state-of-the-art distributed computer vision algorithms on the cloud, as a service to the community. CloudCV will contain algorithms for end-to-end processing of image & video content: from low-level filtering and data processing to high-level tasks like face detection, person detection, object detection, tracking, action and intent detection, etc.Challenge. Designing and implementing efficient and provably correct parallel computer vision algorithms is extremely challenging. Some tasks like extracting statistics from image collections are embarrassingly parallel, i.e. can be parallelized simply by distributing the images to different machines. This is where framework such as MapReduce have demonstrated success. Unfortunately, most tasks in computer vision and machine learning such as training a face detector are not embarrassingly parallel \u2013 there are data and computational dependencies between images and various steps in the algorithm. Moreover, for each such parallel algorithm, researchers must repeatedly solve the same low-level problems: building & maintaining a cluster of machines, formulating parallelizable components in computer vision algorithms, designing multi-threaded primitives, writing custom hardware wrappers, implementing mechanisms to avoid race-conditions, dead-locks, etc.Current status as of February 2015 (and plans till GTC)\u2022 A distributed implementation of panoramic image stitching is available as a web-service.\u2022 We have released 16 \"industry standard\" pre-computed features for all 1.2 million images in the ImageNet Challenge [7], as a resource that others in the community can build on.\u2022 We have released Python and Matlab APIs that allow users to \"call\" CloudCV functions for image stitching and object detection. In all cases, the images are sent to our servers at Virginia Tech and EC2 instances, and and results of the executables are made available to the users' running Python and Matlab instances when ready.\u2022 A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image auto-tagging web-service.\u00a0Both these demos utilize the Caffe framework, and run on NVIDIA Tesla K40s, courtesy of the NVIDIA Academic Hardware Donation Program (NVIDIA contact: Stephen Jones). \u2022 \u00a0Training a new category apart from 1000 categories that are already present in the model.

That\u00a0is why we decided to join forces and apply together this year. Almost every major Web company has now announced their work on a Knowledge Graph, including Google\u2019s Knowledge Graph, Yahoo!\u2019s Web of Objects, Walmart Lab\u2019s Social Genome, Microsoft's Satori Graph / Bing Snapshots and Facebook\u2019s Entity Graph. DBpedia is a community-run project that has been working on a free, open-source knowledge graph since 2006. DBpedia currently describes 38.3 million \u201cthings\u201d of 685 different \u201ctypes\u201d in 125 languages, with over 3\u00a0billion \u201cfacts\u201d (September 2014). It\u00a0is interlinked to\u00a0many other databases (e.g., Freebase, Wikidata, New York Times, CIA Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Linked Data has been revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. While the Web 2.0 technologies opened up much of the \u201cguts\u201d of websites for third-parties to reuse and repurpose data on the Web, they still require that developers create one client per target API. With Linked Data technologies, all APIs are interconnected via standard Web protocols and languages. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g., SPARQL). Have you thought of asking the Web about all cities with low criminality, warm weather and open jobs? That's the kind of query we are talking about. This new Web of interlinked databases provides useful knowledge that can complement the textual Web in many ways. See, for example, how bloggers tag their posts or assign them to categories in order to organize and interconnect their blog posts. This is a very simple way to connect \u201cunstructured\u201d text to a structure (hierarchy of tags). For more advanced examples, see how BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Identifiers and data provided by DBpedia were greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. Or, more recently, did you see that IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge? DBpedia Spotlight is an open-source (Apache license) text annotation tool that connects text to Linked Data by marking names of things in text (we call that Spotting) and selecting between multiple interpretations of these names (we call that Disambiguation). For example, \u201cWashington\u201d can be interpreted in more than 50 ways including a state, a government or a person. You can already imagine that this is not a trivial task, especially when we're talking about millions of things and hundreds of types.

It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection. The proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message.

Reed Elsevier is a global organisation operating in 24 countries and is also listed on several of the world\u2019s major stock exchanges as well being a FTSE 100 and FT Global 500 company. We operate across several professional market segments including Scientific, Technical and Medical, Legal and Exhibitions. We also operate in the Risk Solutions and Business Information sector and LexisNexis Risk Solutions is a leading provider of solutions that combine proprietary, public and 3rd party information with advanced technology and analytics. We produce an open source platform to solve \u2018Big Data\u2019 problems called HPCC Systems\u00ae (High Performance Computing Cluster) which can process, analyse and find links and associations in high volumes of complex data at high speed and with incredible accuracy. HPCC Systems\u00ae has been around for more than a decade, making it the most proven solution of its kind in existence. It is a battle-tested platform for manipulating, transforming, querying and data warehousing Big Data. The data refinery and delivery clusters (Thor and Roxie, respectively) do not need specialised hardware to run, and are usually configured identically. Thor is the data refinery cluster which consumes vast quantities of data. Here the data is transformed, linked and indexed (ETL). It\u2019s a distributed file system with parallel processing power spread across the nodes. Thor clusters can scale from a single node to thousands. Roxie is the query cluster which provides separate high-performance online query processing and data warehousing. It is optimised for concurrent query processing and like Thor, it also scales from a single node to thousands. We have created our own programming language to run on these clusters called, ECL (Enterprise Control Language). It is a powerful programming language, ideally suited for the manipulation of Big Data for many reasons. It is a transparent and implicitly parallel language which is non-procedural and dataflow oriented. Its syntax is also modular, reusable and extensible. It combines data representation and algorithm implementation and is easily extended using C++ libraries. In fact, it is compiled into optimized C++. As well as the clusters, an HPCC System incorporates common middleware components, and external communications layer, client interfaces for end user services and system management and auxiliary components to support monitoring, facilitate loading and storing of filesystem data from external sources. We have our own development environment for developing code (ECL IDE) and the interface we provide for the monitoring and management of HPCC Systems\u00ae environments is called ECL Watch. LexisNexis\u00ae (a division of Reed Elsevier) consolidated its content management, document enhancement and mining systems onto HPCC Systems\u00ae. In doing this, they discovered that the elapsed time taken to perform an enrichment pass of the entire data collection dropped from 6/8 weeks to less than 1 day. This is such a significant change that it means they can increase the degree of enrichment into capabilities that were previously out of reach. Also within Reed Elsevier, HPCC Systems\u00ae has enhanced SciVal which is an analytical solution used by research institutions to get access to facts which support decision making. SciVal users can now customize their own visualizations generated in just a few seconds from the almost 40 terabytes of data underpinning the tool. Since HPCC Systems\u00ae can both crunch huge, predefined requests offline as well as smaller calculations in real time on customer generated data slices, users of SciVal can get structured information immediately upon implementation as well as having the flexibility to tailor-make their own view of the data. It\u2019s not just within Reed Elsevier that we hear of success stories about HPCC Systems\u00ae. Sandia National Laboratories discovered that HPCC Systems met the challenge of sorting through petabytes of data to find correlations and helped them to generate hypotheses. The Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) of a northeastern US state used HPCC Systems\u00ae to help pinpoint fraud, waste and abuse of the system. HPCC Systems\u00ae enabled them to identify the hidden relationships between million-dollar condo dwellers and their assets, providers, medical facilities or others providing care to the state\u2019s Medicaid recipients. They were able to sort, link, join and analyse 50 terabytes of public data to find evidence of fraud committed by a group of state Medicaid recipients who were all living in the same high end condominium complex. Other customers include organizations such as government agencies, businesses, non-profits, academic institutions and consulting firms such as Comrise, Cognizant, Infosys and others. Case studies can be found here: http://hpccsystems.com/why-HPCC/case-studies. Our technology has also been used as a resource to help find missing children. LexisNexis\u00ae has partnered with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) to develop the ADAMSM Program (Automated Delivery of Alerts on Missing children) which uses technology to distribute missing child posters to police, news media, schools, businesses, medical centers and other recipients within a specific geographic search area. To date, 142 children have been reunited with their families as a result of the ADAMSM Program. Working on the HPCC Systems\u00ae project means that you get to contribute to success stories like these. Our developers are passionate about what they do and seek to improve the system so that we can provide a better service to all our customers.

These domains include sensors (for instance, cameras), actuators, and intelligent software in between. It has been designed to help in programming such intelligent software. It is mainly written in C++ language and provides a distributed component-based programming environment where the application program is made up of a collection of several concurrent asynchronous components. Each component may run in different computers and they are connected using ICE communication middleware. Components may be written in C++, python, Java... and all of them interoperate through explicit ICE interfaces. JdeRobot simplifies the access to hardware devices from the control program. Getting sensor measurements is as simple as calling a local function, and ordering motor commands as easy as calling another local function. The platform attaches those calls to the remote invocation on the components connected to the sensor or the actuator devices. They can be connected to real sensors and actuators or simulated ones, both locally or remotely using the network. Those functions build the API for the Hardware Abstraction Layer. The robotic application get the sensor readings and order the actuator commands using it to unfold its behavior. Several driver components have been developed to support different physical sensors, actuators and simulators. The drivers are used as components installed at will depending on your configuration. They are included in the official release. Currently supported robots and devices: JdeRobot includes several robot programming tools and libraries. First, viewers and teleoperators for several robots, its sensors and motors. Second, a camara calibration component and a tunning tool for color filters. Third, VisualHFSM tool for programming robot behavior using hierarchical finite state machines. It includes many sample components using OpenCV, PCL, OpenGL, etc.. In addition, it also provides a library to develop fuzzy controllers, a library for projective geometry and some computer vision processing. Each component may have its own independent Graphical User Interface or none at all. Currently, GTK and Qt libraries are supported, and several examples of OpenGL for 3D graphics with both libraries are included. JdeRobot is open-source software, licensed as GPL and LGPL.

Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can be\u00a0used to build them. LLVM began as a\u00a0research project\u00a0at the\u00a0University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of\u00a0commercial and open sourceprojects as well as being widely used in\u00a0academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under the\u00a0\"UIUC\" BSD-Style license. The primary sub-projects of LLVM are: The\u00a0LLVM Core\u00a0libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent\u00a0optimizer, along with\u00a0code generation support\u00a0for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around a\u00a0well specified\u00a0code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\"). The LLVM Core libraries are\u00a0well documented, and it is particularly easy to invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to use\u00a0LLVM as an optimizer and code generator. Clang\u00a0is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles (e.g. about\u00a03x faster than GCCwhen compiling Objective-C code in a debug configuration), extremely useful\u00a0error and warning messages\u00a0and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The\u00a0Clang Static Analyzer\u00a0is a tool that automatically finds bugs in your code, and is a great example of the sort of tool that can be built using the Clang frontend as a library to parse C/C++ code. dragonegg\u00a0integrates the LLVM optimizers and code generator with the GCC 4.5 parsers. This allows LLVM to compile Ada, Fortran, and other languages supported by the GCC compiler frontends, and access to C features not supported by Clang (such as OpenMP). The\u00a0LLDB\u00a0project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger. It uses the Clang ASTs and expression parser, LLVM JIT, LLVM disassembler, etc so that it provides an experience that \"just works\". It is also blazing fast and much more memory efficient than GDB at loading symbols. The\u00a0libc++\u00a0and\u00a0libc++ ABI\u00a0projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library, including full support for C++'0x. The\u00a0compiler-rt\u00a0project provides highly tuned implementations of the low-level code generator support routines like \"__fixunsdfdi\" and other calls generated when a target doesn't have a short sequence of native instructions to implement a core IR operation. The\u00a0vmkit\u00a0project is an implementation of the Java and .NET Virtual Machines that is built on LLVM technologies. The\u00a0polly\u00a0project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model. The\u00a0libclc\u00a0project aims to implement the OpenCL standard library. The\u00a0klee\u00a0project implements a \"symbolic virtual machine\" which uses a theorem prover to try to evaluate all dynamic paths through a program in an effort to find bugs and to prove properties of functions. A major feature of klee is that it can produce a testcase in the event that it detects a bug. The\u00a0SAFECode\u00a0project is a memory safety compiler for C/C++ programs. It instruments code with run-time checks to detect memory safety errors (e.g., buffer overflows) at run-time. It can be used to protect software from security attacks and can also be used as a memory safety error debugging tool like Valgrind. In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that\u00a0use components of LLVM for various tasks. Through these external projects you can use LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Java, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, and a number of other languages. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers. As much as everything else, LLVM has a broad and friendly community of people who are interested in building great low-level tools. If you are interested in getting involved, a good first place is to skim the\u00a0LLVM Blog\u00a0and to sign up for the\u00a0LLVM Developer mailing list.

Save Lives. Join OpenMRS for Google Summer of Code 2015. Thank you for your interest in OpenMRS! OpenMRS has been accepted for the 9th year as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code in 2015. We're enjoyed participating in this great program in the last 8 years and are even more excited about the projects and mentors we have available this year. Coding for OpenMRS is a great way to practice your coding skills and, at the same time, help benefit people in developing countries who are on the front lines of the battle against HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria. The Summer of Code page on our wiki describes potential projects and our mentors this year. These aren't \"busy work\" - we've reviewed our actual project list and identified ones that can be completed by students (advised by our team of excellent mentors) during Summer of Code this year. Why OpenMRS? Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS - most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases ... if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries - a tide which rises all ships. Our volunteers nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in many countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and many more. This work is supported in part by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Rockefeller Foundation, the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).

What this means to the user is that the available algorithms are all automatically parallelized (asynchronously, coarse-grained approach) making an efficient use of the underlying multi-core architecture. PaGMO can be used to solve constrained, unconstrained, single and multiple objective, continuous mixed integer optimization problems, or to perform research on novel algorithms and paradigms, easily comparing them to state of the art implementations of the established ones. PyKEP is a scientific library providing basic tools for astrodynamics research. Algoritmic efficiency is a main focus of the library, which is written in C++ and exposed to Python using the boost::python library. At the library core is the implementation of an efficient solver for the multiple revolutions Lambert\u2019s problem, objects representing the Sims-Flanagan low-thrust model, efficient keplerian propagators, Taylor-integrators, a SGP4 propagator, TLE and SATCAT support and more. Although for convenience of our users PaGMO and PyKEP are maintained separately, both are crucial components for astrodynamics research, as PaGMO depends on PyKEP in order to approach optimization problems in astrodynamics.\u00a0 Efficient implementations of state-of-the-art bio-inspired algorithms are sided to state-of the art optimization algorithms (Simplex Methods, SQP methods ....) and can be easily mixed (also with user defined algorithms) to build a super-algorithm exploiting cooperation via the asynchronous, generalized island model.Many complex-networks topologies (Hypercube, Ring, Barabasi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz, Erdos-Renyi, etc.) are built-in and may be used to define the migration pathways of good solutions among islands. Custom topologies are also possible. On the other hand, PyKEP allows for defining and simulating complex interplanetary trajectory optimization problem, which then can be natively solved by a multitude of optimization schemes using PaGMO. PaGMO/PyKEP, although originated as one of the internal projects of the Advanced Concepts Team (ACT) of the European Space Agency (ESA), became an independent open-source project in 2008, and is currently\u00a0spanning over\u00a0the communities of\u00a0researchers and high-performance computing developers from different\u00a0academic and industry backgrounds.", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2015/orgs/pagmo/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "https://github.com/esa/pagmo/wiki/GSoC-2015", "name": "PaGMO / PyKEP", "num_projects": 1, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2015},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: https://groups.google.com/group/pencilcode-development\n   Pencil Code is a\u00a0programming\u00a0tool\u00a0for beginning coders.\u00a0We help\u00a0beginners learn\u00a0professional languages with a novel block-and-code editor for Javascript and Coffeescript, a jQuery turtle library, and a\u00a0node.js server that provides storage and socket.io services. \u00a0Pencil Code has been used in classrooms from K-12 to college.

Sometimes when a solution of sugar and water becomes super-saturated, from it precipitates a pure, delicious, and diabetes-inducing crystal of sweetness, induced by no more than the tap of a finger. So it is today with numeric and visualization libraries for Ruby. The SciRuby project\u00a0is oriented towards providing computational research infrastructure. Infrastructure was the single common area of need identified by scientists, researchers, and engineers in discussions at the GSoC 2013 mentor summit. SciRuby consists of a fairly large number of gems, including statsample, statsample-glm, statsample-timeseries, distribution, minimization, integration, rubyvis, plotrb, Nyaplot, MDArray, Publisci, Ruby-Band, and NMatrix. The last of these has been awarded grants by the Ruby Association (which develops the Ruby language) as well as Brighter Planet, and has a goal of supplying Ruby with a robust, versatile linear algebra library with support for both dense and sparse matrices. Statsample and its related packages (e.g., distribution) aim to provide the Ruby language with statistical analysis packages. A major portion of our gems have been written by GSoC students\u00a0\u2014 including Nyaplot, plotrb, PubliSci, Ruby-Band, statsample-timeseries, and statsample-glm. Others, like minimization and integration, have been overhauled over the course of Summer of Code projects. Working on SciRuby is a chance to get involved at the ground floor on a project which is viewed as critical by many Rubyists, including Ruby's creator, Matz. Further, since we are a science-related project, we expect that successful student projects could lead to publications.

Code sizes are typically reduced by a factor of two to three when compared to an equivalent Java application. Many existing companies who depend on Java for business critical applications are turning to Scala to boost their development productivity, applications scalability and overall reliability. Scala runs on the JVM (by default) and on JavaScript (via Scala.js), integrating near-seamlessly with libraries on these respective platforms.

Many individuals and organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information so people can better understand they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This information is provided through our\u00a0Know Your Enemy series of papers. Information For those who are already aware and concerned, we provide details to better secure and defend your resources. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our\u00a0Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic\u00a0Scan of the Month challenges. Tools For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. We provide these through our Tools Site.

Our primary goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program, so as to facilitate a sophisticated way of thinking about and creating media at a time when such knowledge is crucial. We do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes Processing (Java), p5.js (Javascript), and Processing.py (Python). We serve a growing community of artists, designers, educators, programmers, engineers, and anyone in between who has an inclination toward both the arts and technology. Core to our belief is that learning how to program is a process of learning how to think, rather than acquiring a certain skillset, so that this knowledge may be applied to any number of fields, from creating artworks to imagining new technologies. We view Processing as a means to bridge seemingly disparate disciplines, providing platforms for collaboration between communities that might not otherwise have had access to each other. We also envision Processing as a new tool for both artists and technologists to use in their work, as a medium and as a context.

Many of those ideas are applicable to solving some of today's problems we face when writing parallel applications for modern multi-core machines. For this reason we center our effort around HPX (High Performance ParalleX), a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale, which implements many of those ideas. The goal for HPX is to create a high quality, freely available, open source implementation of the ParalleX model for conventional systems, such as classic Linux based Beowulf clusters or multi-socket highly parallel SMP nodes. At the same time, we want to have a very modular and well designed runtime system architecture which would allow us to port our implementation onto new computer system architectures. We use real world applications to drive the development of the runtime system, coining out required functionalities and converging onto an stable API which will provide a smooth migration path for developers. The API exposed by HPX is modeled after the interfaces defined by the C++ ISO standard and adheres to the programming guidelines used by the Boost collection of C++ libraries.

Tux Paint, led by Bill Kendrick, is an award-winning and widely used artistic graphics program. Tux Paint is enjoyable for everyone from the youngest children capable of using computers up through adults. Tux Math (originally written by Bill Kendrick, now led by David Bruce, Tim Holy and Aaditya Maheshwari) is a video game-style math drill program. It covers basic math operations up through topics such as negative numbers, factoring, and order-of-operations exercises. Tux Typing (originally written by Sam Hart, now led by David Bruce) offers word typing practice in the setting of two video game-type activities, as well as phrase and sentence typing for older students. All three programs are SDL-based C apps, licensed under the GPL. They are developed natively on Linux and are included in all major desktop distributions, as well as non-Linux Free Software collections such as the FreeBSD Ports Collection and the MacPorts project for OS-X. Builds are also available for Microsoft Windows and Haiku/BeOS. The aim is to avoid specific platform dependencies so the programs can be made available as widely as possible, including the computing environments that children are most likely to actually encounter in schools. Similarly, all three programs are extensively internationalized using the standard GNU gettext library.

Blender Foundation supports and facilitates these goals - even employs a small staff for that - but fully depends on the online community to achieve it. Since 2005, Blender Foundation has organized four short films and a game project, which helped Blender tremendously to get more accepted by professionals in their daily work.

The FreeBSD Project began over 20 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work at Berkeley CSRG with open source revision history going back 35 years to 1978. \u00a0Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals. FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices.\u00a0 There are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development (this is also where our summer of code students have worked in previous years). We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. \u00a0FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary. In addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM, and OpenPAM", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014/orgs/freebsd/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2014Ideas", "name": "FreeBSD", "num_projects": 14, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2014},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: devl@freenetproject.org", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Google_Summer_of_Code/2014", "name": "Freenet Project Inc", "num_projects": 3, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2014},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: http://freifunk.net/mailman/listinfo/wlanware\n   We build the local Internet of the world. Freifunk is the GSoC umbrella organization for many community networks in the world. We develop firmwares for routers, routing protocols, wifi mesh solutions, auto-flasher for network devices, network libraries for Linux distros, security tools for secure communication, puppet configurations for local school networks, OpenWrt packages, automatic map solutions for networks, GSM meshes, and a lot more. You will find us anywhere where people build communication infrastructures.  We are organized locally and completely decentralized - just like our decentralized networks, that are set up as self-building, self-healing meshes using Open Source technologies and routing protocols such as BATMAN, OLSR, Babel and others. Over ten years agao different free network initiatives in Germany united under the label freifunk. That was in 2003. In other regions projects came together as Guifi.net in Spain, Ninux in Italy and other local names.  While you may have never heard of us, community network groups do exist in every major city of the world and you may even find us in an unknown village in Afghanistan, Zambia, Mexico, Greece, Spain, Chile, France, Italy or like recently on a traditional Christmas market in Germany. Some of our friends in the community who prefer to keep a \"lower profile\" are helping people to communicate in difficult environments in Iran and Syria. And other exciting things are happening. Software, networks, content - it is not enough. We are working on Open Hardware, re-programming chips and testing the limits of software and hardware. The idea of a self-recharging router has been around for a while and we are now building a truly low cost solar router putting the complete schematics online. Others are working on extremely low cost self-deploying wifi phone networks. We are exploring GSM technologies, setting up Open Source GSM mobile phone networks at festivals offering free communications with your personal mobile phone. There are really nice apps that you can think of, if you have your personal cell phone operator. A lot of the cool stuff happening might depend on one enthusiastic individual, other projects in the community involve dozens of developers and there are so much more things we could do together with you. Some freifunk networks are using satellites to distribute Internet to remote regions - we want the complete stack Open Sourced. There are serious discussions about sending mini-satellites into orbit.  Years ago when the first contributors started to work on mesh networks, many believed - 20 routers in a mesh will be the absolute maximum and the scientific community regarded a lot of the ideas and work of community enthusiasts as impossible. Today we have over 16000 devices in the local network of Guifi.net in Catalunya and initiatives that cooperate in EU wide research projects with top research institutions and universities.

Due to its lightweight, easy to manage agent, Ganglia is now used in many educational institutions, corporations, research organizations and ISPs.  Many IT professionals come across it in their job every time they have a scalability problem with an application.  Students can probably find it on your own campus, just look for /etc/gmond.conf on UNIX machines to find clues about where the metrics are sent.  Many institutions expose their Ganglia web reports publicly, they can be easily found with a Google query Performance monitoring offers an excellent opportunity for students to develop core skills in many areas including networking, operating systems and also more advanced areas like data science, machine learning, statistics and prediction. The lightweight Ganglia agent, gmond, is written in C and runs on every machine being monitored.  The agent can be extended with plugins written in C or Python to extract metrics from the machine or applications being monitored.  Application monitoring can also be achieved for Java (using JMXetric with Tomcat, JBoss, Spring, etc). The Ganglia data collection and storage process, Gmetad, is also written in C.  It uses the legendary RRDtool for storing the time series data. The Ganglia web reporting system is built with PHP, JavaScript and jQuery.  It does not have any database dependency.  It constructs RRDtool queries/command lines to graph the data. Various integration solutions exist, such as ganglia-nagios-bridge which is developed in Python.  This allows the metrics discovered by Ganglia to be used for alerting in Nagios. Ganglia is a BSD-licensed open-source project that grew out of the University of California, Berkeley Millennium Project which was initially funded in large part by the National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (NPACI) and National Science Foundation RI Award EIA-9802069 For some tips about making an application, please see this blog from Ganglia developer Daniel Pocock", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014/orgs/ganglia/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "https://github.com/ganglia/monitor-core/wiki/GSoC-2014-project-ideas", "name": "Ganglia", "num_projects": 4, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2014},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: gcc@gcc.gnu.org", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014/orgs/gcc/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SummerOfCode", "name": "GCC - GNU Compiler Collection", "num_projects": 5, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2014},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: mailto:gentoo-soc@lists.gentoo.org\n   [IMAGE http://dev.gentoo.org/~dberkholz/images/sign-big-150dpi-magnified-name-200x200.png]", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014/orgs/gentoo/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://wiki.gentoo.org/index.php?title=Google_Summer_of_Code/2014/Ideas", "name": "Gentoo Foundation", "num_projects": 3, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2014},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: git@vger.kernel.org", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014/orgs/git/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://git.github.io/SoC-2014-Ideas.html", "name": "Git", "num_projects": 2, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2014},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/desktop-devel-list", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014/orgs/gnome/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/SummerOfCode/2014/Ideas", "name": "GNOME", "num_projects": 35, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2014},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gnss-sdr-developers", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014/orgs/gnss_sdr/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://gnss-sdr.org/documentation/google-summer-code-2014-ideas-list", "name": "GNSS-SDR", "num_projects": 4, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2014},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: https://mailman.cae.wisc.edu/listinfo/octave-maintainers", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014/orgs/octave/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://wiki.octave.org/Summer_of_Code_Project_Ideas", "name": "GNU Octave", "num_projects": 3, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2014},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/summer-of-code/", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014/orgs/gnu/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://www.gnu.org/software/soc-projects/ideas-2014.html", "name": "GNU Project", "num_projects": 17, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2014},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/MailingLists\n   GNU Radio is a free library for developing Software Defined Radio applications.

Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can be\u00a0used to build them. LLVM began as a\u00a0research project\u00a0at the\u00a0University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of\u00a0commercial and open sourceprojects as well as being widely used in\u00a0academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under the\u00a0\"UIUC\" BSD-Style license. The primary sub-projects of LLVM are: The\u00a0LLVM Core\u00a0libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent\u00a0optimizer, along with\u00a0code generation support\u00a0for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around a\u00a0well specified\u00a0code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\"). The LLVM Core libraries are\u00a0well documented, and it is particularly easy to invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to use\u00a0LLVM as an optimizer and code generator. Clang\u00a0is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles (e.g. about\u00a03x faster than GCCwhen compiling Objective-C code in a debug configuration), extremely useful\u00a0error and warning messages\u00a0and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The\u00a0Clang Static Analyzer\u00a0is a tool that automatically finds bugs in your code, and is a great example of the sort of tool that can be built using the Clang frontend as a library to parse C/C++ code. dragonegg\u00a0integrates the LLVM optimizers and code generator with the GCC 4.5 parsers. This allows LLVM to compile Ada, Fortran, and other languages supported by the GCC compiler frontends, and access to C features not supported by Clang (such as OpenMP). The\u00a0LLDB\u00a0project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger. It uses the Clang ASTs and expression parser, LLVM JIT, LLVM disassembler, etc so that it provides an experience that \"just works\". It is also blazing fast and much more memory efficient than GDB at loading symbols. The\u00a0libc++\u00a0and\u00a0libc++ ABI\u00a0projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library, including full support for C++'0x. The\u00a0compiler-rt\u00a0project provides highly tuned implementations of the low-level code generator support routines like \"__fixunsdfdi\" and other calls generated when a target doesn't have a short sequence of native instructions to implement a core IR operation. The\u00a0vmkit\u00a0project is an implementation of the Java and .NET Virtual Machines that is built on LLVM technologies. The\u00a0polly\u00a0project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model. The\u00a0libclc\u00a0project aims to implement the OpenCL standard library. The\u00a0klee\u00a0project implements a \"symbolic virtual machine\" which uses a theorem prover to try to evaluate all dynamic paths through a program in an effort to find bugs and to prove properties of functions. A major feature of klee is that it can produce a testcase in the event that it detects a bug. The\u00a0SAFECode\u00a0project is a memory safety compiler for C/C++ programs. It instruments code with run-time checks to detect memory safety errors (e.g., buffer overflows) at run-time. It can be used to protect software from security attacks and can also be used as a memory safety error debugging tool like Valgrind. In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that\u00a0use components of LLVM for various tasks. Through these external projects you can use LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Java, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, and a number of other languages. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers. As much as everything else, LLVM has a broad and friendly community of people who are interested in building great low-level tools. If you are interested in getting involved, a good first place is to skim the\u00a0LLVM Blog\u00a0and to sign up for the\u00a0LLVM Developer mailing list.

Save Lives. Join OpenMRS for Google Summer of Code 2014. Thank you for your interest in OpenMRS! OpenMRS has been accepted for the 8th year as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code in 2014. We're enjoyed participating in this great program in the last 7 years and are even more excited about the projects and mentors we have available this year. Coding for OpenMRS is a great way to practice your coding skills and, at the same time, help benefit people in developing countries who are on the front lines of the battle against HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria. The Summer of Code page on our wiki describes potential projects and our mentors this year. These aren't \"busy work\" - we've reviewed our actual project list and identified ones that can be completed by students (advised by our team of excellent mentors) during Summer of Code this year. Why OpenMRS? Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS - most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases ... if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries - a tide which rises all ships. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by Regenstrief Institute, a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health, a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in many countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and many more. This work is supported in part by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Rockefeller Foundation, the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).

It smoothly integrates features of object-oriented and functional languages, enabling Java and other programmers to be more productive. Code sizes are typically reduced by a factor of two to three when compared to an equivalent Java application. Many existing companies who depend on Java for business critical applications are turning to Scala to boost their development productivity, applications scalability and overall reliability. Scala runs on the JVM integrating near-seamlessly with libraries on that platform. Javascript backend is currently actively developed for Scala (https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js). This signficantly reduces barriers to adoption and has been a key factor in Scala\u2019s success. Worldwide, there are an estimated 100,000 skilled Scala programmers - a number that is continually increasing. We run very succesful Scala Days conferences in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 which gathered significant interest within the community - both conferences were quickly sold out before the deadline. We expect an even larger turnout for this year\u2019s conference in Berlin. Scala development is supported by quality development tools: Jenkins for build, issue tracking with Jira, mailing lists (user discussions as well as architecture decisions are made there) and an extensive test-suite. All Scala source code is currently at github and we are receiving a lot of contributions from the community. The Scala team was participating in GSOC 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 editions and we had many successful projects that were involved in extending the main language compiler, improving IDE support and working on external open-source projects that were written in Scala (like Akka or Lift or Kojo).

You can do a single race against other karts, compete in one of several Grand Prix, try to beat the high score in time trials on your own, play battle mode against your friends, and more!  The game in its current form has been under steady development since 2006 and has been downloaded more than 2 million times worldwide. It was SourceForge's \"Project of the Month\" in April 2013, and is included in all major Linux distributions (OpenSUSE, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, etc.). It was used by Microsoft in their IllumiRoom trailer, and even used in a TV series (\u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d, Season 3, Episode 11).  Who is the SuperTuxKart Team? The game SuperTuxKart is developed by a group of volunteers. We have a set of people working professionally in the IT area ready to mentor new students. Teaching and mentoring people interested in game development was always an important aspect of developing SuperTuxKart.  What does the game look like?

Catrobat and the software developed by the Catrobat team are inspired by the Scratch programming system developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. Catroid is an Android app that allows to create and execute Catrobat programs on Android phones and tablets. Catroid allows kids and teens from age 8 up to easily create Android apps using only their mobile device, without the need for an additional PC. Catrobat programs are assembled in a graphical \u201cLego\u201d-type style as known from Scratch (only for PCs) or AppInventor (also needs a PC for develoment and is less oriented towards kids or teens). Paintroid is part of the Catrobat project and is a graphical paint editor for the Android platform that, among others, allows setting parts of pictures to transparent (pinch zoom up to single pixel level), which is an important feature if one wants to extract, e.g., one\u2019s own head from a photograph while deleting all the background, or some other part from any image, in order to use the resulting shape as a graphical element inside one\u2019s app. Catroid\u2019s Web 2.0 community site allows kids and teens to share their apps in a way similar to Scratch's community site, including the sharing and remixing of Catrobat programs under the AGPL license, the aim being to facilitate the learning of programming skills among kids and teens (and also older users). Typical users of Catroid would be, e.g. an 11 year old girl wanting to share her Hannah Montana animation with her friends, or a 15 year old boy wanting to implement a multi-player multi-touch space invaders game. Thus, usability is a major aspect of the project and is accorded top priority. The motivation behind the Catrobat project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world. The Catrobat team released a first public beta in March 2012. There are several subprojects involving, e.g., the bidirectional coupling with an AR.Drone quadcopter, with a Lego Mindstorms robot, with a Robocup soccer robot via the Arduino open-source electronics platform, a program that allows to package a Catroid project as an apk file (i.e., as a stand-alone Android app), an HTML5 player (though not supporting all Catroid features as not all sensors etc can be accessed), a localization / internationalization support site (we currently support several languages, with speakers of English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Arabian, German, Turkish, French, Japanese, Urdu, and Malaysian in the team), and the building of an engaging tutorial game inspired by the funny tutorial of Nintendo\u2019s Wario Ware: D.I.Y. programming game for the Nintendo DS. The Catrobat team currently is composed of more than 100 active developers. We use the test-driven development method (test-first style; tests used as declarative executable program documentation) with several additional practices from extreme programming such as ping pong pair programming in frequently changing pairs, kanban system, very clear self-explaining clean code (including test code; no comments in code unless not expressible in the code itself; no prose documentation), continuous usability consideration (paper prototyping on a daily basis, the personas method, usability expert feedbacks, and usability tests with children), continuous integration using git, automated unit-, functional-, regression-, and monkey-testing, permanent refactoring, the YAGNI principle, and collective code ownership. External contributors will need to follow our test-driven development method. While we minimize the amount of test code and are very pragmatic, please understand that we are concerned of producing high quality and highly maintainable code that can be extended and refactored without the need for direct human communication, and without the need to refer to non-executable documents.", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2013/orgs/catroid_project/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://goo.gl/z3stf", "name": "Catroid Project", "num_projects": 9, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2013},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: mailto:sft-gsoc@cern.ch\n   The SFT (Software for Experiments) group is part of CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch), and focuses on providing common software for its experiments. CERN is one of the world\u2019s largest and most exciting centers for fundamental physics research. Experiments at CERN have probed the fundamental nature of matter and the forces which affect it. CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web (http://info.cern.ch), invented by Tim Berners-Lee. The SFT group's efforts, like most of CERN's current activities, are directed towards the world\u2019s highest-energy elementary particle accelerator - the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html) and its experiments. There are four large experiments at the LHC (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb) which seek to expand the frontiers of knowledge and complete our understanding of the constituents of matter and their interactions, of the conditions in the first instants after the Big Bang and of the differences between matter and anti-matter. During 2012, ATLAS and CMS announced the discovery of a new boson, which has been confirmed recently to have the properties of a Higgs boson - similar to the one required by the Standard Model of Particle Physics.\u00a0 NOTE: The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge. Operating the LHC and running each experiment requires a large amount of software. A large part of this software is common and open source. The open source software spans the range from system software to more specialized physics-oriented tools and toolkits. The Root system (http://root.cern.ch/) is used to handle, store and analyze the data of all LHC experiments. The experiments store both their raw data and intermediate, processed results using Root, as it offers an open source format and is very compact. Having the data defined as a set of objects, it is possible to get access separately to particular attributes of the selected objects, without touching the remaining attributes. Root includes many tools for analysis of data, from histograming methods in an arbitrary number of dimensions, curve fitting, function evaluation, minimization, graphics and visualization. It includes also a built-in C++ interpreter the command language which is used as a scripting, or macro language. The CERN Virtual Machine (CernVM, http://cernvm.cern.ch) is an R&D project established in the Software group of CERN\u2019s Physics Department (PH/SFT) to investigate how virtualization technologies can be used to improve and simplify the daily interaction of physicists with experiment software frameworks and the Grid infrastructure. CernVM maintains a Virtual Software Appliance designed to provide a complete and portable environment for developing and running LHC data analysis applications on any end user computer (laptop, desktop) as well as on the Grid and on Clouds. The Geant4 toolkit (http://cern.ch/geant4) is a key component of the common physics software. It simulates the interactions of radiation with material in any setup, including the detectors of the LHC or other High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. Uses in other fields including medical diagnostics and to satellite engineering and planetary science. One use is assessing the effects of radiation on the electronics of satellites. Another is in designing improved medical detectors with specialised applications such as the Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission GATE (http://www.opengatecollaboration.org). LHC experiments use Geant4 to compare the signatures of events from new physics (such as the Higgs boson and particles which are candidates for dark matter) to the signatures of events coming from known interactions which could mimic them. Geant4 is created by the Geant4 collaboration (http://geant4.org) of over 100 physicists and engineers from around the world, bringing together teams at leading High Energy Physics laboratories such as CERN (Geneva, Switzerland), Fermilab (Batavia, IL), KEK (Tsukuba, Japan), SLAC (Stanford, CA) and Triumf (Vancouver, Canada), as well as many universities and institutions. The toolkit continues to be developed to improve its precision and scope of application, and to better utilise current and emerging computer architectures.

Our flagship projects include: - The Gene Wiki, an initiative to create a continuously-updated, community-reviewed, and collaboratively-written review article for every human gene. The Gene Wiki receives over 50 million pageviews per year by both scientists and the general public. - BioGPS, a community-extensible gene annotation portal for aggregating and integrating gene-centric knowledge. This resource is more focused on active researchers, and it receives approximately two million pageviews per year. Through these efforts, we\u2019ve already demonstrated that we can productively harness the efforts of thousands of scientists and community members. We\u2019ve thus far focused on huge challenges in biological knowledge management. To complement the collaborative spirit of these projects, we have recently turned our own software development projects into open source projects.", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2013/orgs/scripps_crowdbio/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://sulab.org/gsoc/#ideas", "name": "Crowdsourcing Biology at the Scripps Research Institute", "num_projects": 4, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2013},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: http://lists.crypto-stick.org/mailman/listinfo/dev\n   The Crypto Stick projects develops Open Source software for next generation security USB keys with an integrated smart card for authentication in the Internet, to enable highly secure encryption of e-mails and data, and for access control.

DBpedia is\u00a0a community-run project that has\u00a0been working on\u00a0a free, open-source knowledge graph since 2006. DBpedia currently exists in\u00a097 different languages, and\u00a0is\u00a0interlinked with many other databases (e.g. Freebase, New\u00a0York Times, CIA\u00a0Factbook) and\u00a0hopefully, with this GSoC to\u00a0Wikidata, too. The\u00a0knowledge in\u00a0DBpedia is\u00a0exposed through a\u00a0set of\u00a0technologies called Linked Data. Linked Data has\u00a0been revolutionizing the\u00a0way applications interact with the\u00a0Web. While the\u00a0Web2.0 technologies opened up\u00a0much of\u00a0the \u201cguts\u201d of\u00a0websites for\u00a0third-parties to\u00a0reuse and\u00a0repurpose data on\u00a0the Web, they still require that developers create one\u00a0client per\u00a0target API. With Linked Data technologies, all\u00a0APIs are\u00a0interconnected via\u00a0standard Web\u00a0protocols and\u00a0languages. One\u00a0can navigate this Web\u00a0of\u00a0facts with standard Web\u00a0browsers, automated crawlers or\u00a0pose complex querie with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL). Have you\u00a0thought of\u00a0asking the\u00a0Web about all\u00a0cities with low\u00a0criminality, warm weather and\u00a0open jobs? That's the\u00a0kind of\u00a0query we\u00a0are talking about. This new\u00a0Web of\u00a0interlinked databases provides useful knowledge that can\u00a0complement the\u00a0textual Web\u00a0in\u00a0many ways. See, for\u00a0example, how\u00a0bloggers tag\u00a0their posts or\u00a0assign them to\u00a0categories in\u00a0order to\u00a0organize and\u00a0interconnect their blog posts. This is\u00a0a very simple way\u00a0to\u00a0connect \u201cunstructured\u201d text to\u00a0a structure (hierarchy of\u00a0tags). For\u00a0more advanced examples, see\u00a0how BBC\u00a0has created the\u00a0World Cup\u00a02010 website by\u00a0interconnecting textual content and\u00a0facts from their knowledge base. Identifiers and\u00a0data provided by\u00a0DBpedia were greatly involved in\u00a0creating this knowledge graph. Or, more recently, did\u00a0you see\u00a0that IBM's Watson Watson used DBpedia data to\u00a0win the\u00a0Jeopardy challenge? DBpedia Spotlight is\u00a0an open source (Apache license) text annotation tool that connects text to\u00a0Linked Data by\u00a0marking names of\u00a0things in\u00a0text (we call that Spotting) and\u00a0selecting between multiple interpretations of\u00a0these names (we call that Disambiguation).

Freenet is decentralised to make it less vulnerable to attack, and if used in \"darknet\" mode, where users only connect to their friends, is very difficult to detect. Communications by Freenet nodes are encrypted and are routed through other nodes to make it extremely difficult to determine who is requesting the information and what its content is. Users contribute to the network by giving bandwidth and a portion of their hard drive (called the \"data store\") for storing files. Files are automatically kept or deleted depending on how popular they are, with the least popular being discarded to make way for newer or more popular content. Files are encrypted, so generally the user cannot easily discover what is in his datastore, and hopefully can't be held accountable for it. Chat forums, websites, and search functionality, are all built on top of this distributed data store. Freenet has been downloaded over 2 million times since the project started, and used for the distribution of censored information all over the world including countries such as China and the Middle East. Ideas and concepts pioneered in Freenet have had a significant impact in the academic world. Our 2000 paper \"Freenet: A Distributed Anonymous Information Storage and Retrieval System\" was the most cited computer science paper of 2000 according to Citeseer, and Freenet has also inspired papers in the worlds of law and philosophy. Ian Clarke, Freenet's creator and project coordinator, was selected as one of the top 100 innovators of 2003 by MIT's Technology Review magazine. An important recent development, which very few other networks have, is the \"darknet\": By only connecting to people they trust, users can greatly reduce their vulnerability, and yet still connect to a global network through their friends' friends' friends and so on. This enables people to use Freenet even in places where Freenet may be illegal, makes it very difficult for governments to block it, and does not rely on tunneling to the \"free world\".

Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can be\u00a0used to build them. LLVM began as a\u00a0research project\u00a0at the\u00a0University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of\u00a0commercial and open sourceprojects as well as being widely used in\u00a0academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under the\u00a0\"UIUC\" BSD-Style license. The primary sub-projects of LLVM are: The\u00a0LLVM Core\u00a0libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent\u00a0optimizer, along with\u00a0code generation support\u00a0for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around a\u00a0well specified\u00a0code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\"). The LLVM Core libraries are\u00a0well documented, and it is particularly easy to invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to use\u00a0LLVM as an optimizer and code generator. Clang\u00a0is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles (e.g. about\u00a03x faster than GCCwhen compiling Objective-C code in a debug configuration), extremely useful\u00a0error and warning messages\u00a0and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The\u00a0Clang Static Analyzer\u00a0is a tool that automatically finds bugs in your code, and is a great example of the sort of tool that can be built using the Clang frontend as a library to parse C/C++ code. dragonegg\u00a0integrates the LLVM optimizers and code generator with the GCC 4.5 parsers. This allows LLVM to compile Ada, Fortran, and other languages supported by the GCC compiler frontends, and access to C features not supported by Clang (such as OpenMP). The\u00a0LLDB\u00a0project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger. It uses the Clang ASTs and expression parser, LLVM JIT, LLVM disassembler, etc so that it provides an experience that \"just works\". It is also blazing fast and much more memory efficient than GDB at loading symbols. The\u00a0libc++\u00a0and\u00a0libc++ ABI\u00a0projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library, including full support for C++'0x. The\u00a0compiler-rt\u00a0project provides highly tuned implementations of the low-level code generator support routines like \"__fixunsdfdi\" and other calls generated when a target doesn't have a short sequence of native instructions to implement a core IR operation. The\u00a0vmkit\u00a0project is an implementation of the Java and .NET Virtual Machines that is built on LLVM technologies. The\u00a0polly\u00a0project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model. The\u00a0libclc\u00a0project aims to implement the OpenCL standard library. The\u00a0klee\u00a0project implements a \"symbolic virtual machine\" which uses a theorem prover to try to evaluate all dynamic paths through a program in an effort to find bugs and to prove properties of functions. A major feature of klee is that it can produce a testcase in the event that it detects a bug. The\u00a0SAFECode\u00a0project is a memory safety compiler for C/C++ programs. It instruments code with run-time checks to detect memory safety errors (e.g., buffer overflows) at run-time. It can be used to protect software from security attacks and can also be used as a memory safety error debugging tool like Valgrind. In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that\u00a0use components of LLVM for various tasks. Through these external projects you can use LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Java, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, and a number of other languages. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers. As much as everything else, LLVM has a broad and friendly community of people who are interested in building great low-level tools. If you are interested in getting involved, a good first place is to skim the\u00a0LLVM Blog\u00a0and to sign up for the\u00a0LLVM Developer mailing list.

Is OGRE A Game Engine?No. OGRE can be (and indeed has been) used to make games, but OGRE is deliberately designed to provide just a world-class graphics solution; for other features like sound, networking, AI, collision, physics etc, you will need to integrate it with other libraries, something several frameworks have done, and we have a collision / physics reference integration library as an example in our distribution. Why? Well, one reason is that not everyone who needs a 3D engine wants to make games, so we don\u2019t assume that you do \u2013 you can use OGRE for games, simulations, business applications, anything at all. Secondly, even within the games industry, requirements can vary widely; for example a MMORPG will need a very different kind of network library than an FPS, and a flight sim will need a different kind of collision / physics system to fighting game. If OGRE included all these features, we would be enforcing a particular set of libraries on you, with an inbuilt set of assumed requirements, and that\u2019s not good design. Instead, we provide a very integration friendly API and let YOU choose the other libraries, if you want them. Many experienced game developers have expressed their approval of this approach, because there are no inbuilt constraints. It can be more daunting for newer users who just want to build another FPS-style game, but for those people there are a growing number of existing frameworks using OGRE which provide a complete solution using a given combo of libraries; but it\u2019s important to realise that OGRE itself will always remain separate, flexible enough to be incorporated into any of these. The principle is of collaboration and integration with other libraries, rather than assimilation of them, a standard tenet of component-based design. Why should I consider using OGRE (rather than the other zillion 3D engines out there)?Many other engines, whilst technically impressive, lack the cohesive design and the consistent documentation to allow them to be used effectively. Many of them have long features lists, but have the feel of a bunch of tech demos lashed together with twine, with no clear vision to hold them together. Like any other software system this becomes their downfall as they become larger. Most other engines are also designed for one particular style of game or demo (e.g. first-person shooters, terrain roamers). OGRE is different. OGRE is design-led rather than feature-led. Every feature that goes into OGRE is considered throughly and slotted into the overall design as elegantly as possible and is always fully documented, meaning that the features which are there always feel part of a cohesive whole. Quality is favoured over quantity, because quantity can come later \u2013 quality can never be added in retrospect. OGRE uses sound design principles learned, tried and tested many times in commercial-grade software \u2013 the object-orientation mentioned in it\u2019s moniker is just one of those approaches \u2013 frequent use of design patterns is another. The core development team is kept deliberately small, and all of its members are veteren software engineers with many years of real-world experience. Patches are welcomed from community, but they undergo a strict review for both quality and cohesion with the Ogre philosophy before being accepted. OGRE does not assume what type of game or demo you want to make. It uses a flexible class hierarchy allowing you to design plugins to specialise the scene organisation approach taken to allow you to make any kind of scene you like. Want to render indoor levels fast? Fine, use the BSP/PVS plugin scene manager which has already been written. Want an outdoor landscape? Again, use another plugin scene manager. The rest of the engine continues to function exactly as before. So the short answer is \u2013 if you favour design quality, flexibility and clear documentation, choose OGRE. You know it makes sense.\u00a0[IMAGE http://www.ogre3d.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif] Is it really free?The Ogre source is made available under the MIT License, which basically means you can use it however you like as long as you include the content of our COPYING file somewhere in your application. The source to your application, or your modifications to Ogre do not have to be released (although it would be nice if you did). See the licensing page for full licensing terms. How do I find out more?If you want to find out about the principles under which OGRE has been developed and to get a quick overview of the design, go to the OGRE Manual now. You can also read the tutorials to help you get started, and then reference the API documentation online. The best way to appreciate OGRE is to use it. I recommend using Mercurial to download the latest version since the code is under constant improvement. If you don\u2019t want to use Mercurial, a snapshot is released periodically for download. For both these options, see the downloads page. If you have any specific questions, just email the project manager using the email address listed on the team page. \u00a0[IMAGE http://bluefilms.fanz.in/fanzin/prd/templates/fanzin/v3/images/play.png]", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2013/orgs/ogre/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=Help+Requested", "name": "OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine)", "num_projects": 5, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2013},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/open-lighting\n   The Open Lighting Project is an effort to build high quality, open source software for the entertainment lighting industry. Brief Background of Entertainment Lighting Entertainment lighting is used in venues such as theaters, bars, theme parks, and cruise ships and the industry has typically been slow to adopt new technologies. Until recently, most lighting equipment has been controlled over a unidirectional RS-485 channel, using the DMX512 standard (written in 1986, revised since and now know as ANSI E1.11 - 2008). The use of a serial link severely limits data rate, and means data distribution products such as wireless links are expensive due to the small market. In the late 1990s, the growing popularity of Ethernet led to some within the industry to consider DMX over IP protocols. By the early 2000s, no less than 6 DMX over IP protocols had been developed, some proprietary and others public. An effort commenced to define an industry standard protocol, but scope creep meant this wasn\u2019t published until 2009. The Open Lighting Project The Open Lighting Project was started in 2004 as a college honors project. The flagship product, OLA (Open Lighting Architecture: http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/Open_Lighting_Architecture) now supports 5 DMX-over-IP protocols. This was initially done by reverse engineering but recently some manufacturers have released the specifications of their proprietary protocols. OLA enables end users to use lighting equipment from different manufacturers on an IP network, freeing customers from vendor lock in.  OLA now supports 21 USB to DMX512 adaptors, allowing users to distribute the DMX control information over IP and then convert to traditional DMX512 for legacy devices. OLA also supports ANSI E1.31 (2009), the new standard for DMX over IP.  In 2010 we began work on RDM (Remote Device Management: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDM_(lighting) ), a relatively new standard published by ANSI in 2006 which, for the first time, enables bi-directional control of lighting devices. This means that rather than relying on visual inspections, lighting operators can be notified when abnormal conditions such as over heating occur with the lighting devices. RDM is starting to see significant uptake within the industry. In early 2011 we released the Automated RDM Responder Tests (http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/RDM_Responder_Testing), a collection of test cases which can be used to evaluate the quality of RDM enabled lighting hardware. As part of the Summer of Code 2012 our student built a web frontend to the RDM tests which combined with the Raspberry Pi platform brought the RDM testing platform to even more users.", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2013/orgs/openlighting/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/OLA_SOC_Ideas_Page", "name": "Open Lighting Project", "num_projects": 1, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2013},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/openflow-discuss\n   As inventors of OpenFlow and SDN, we seek to \"open up the Internet infrastructure for innovations\" and enable the larger network industry to build networks that offer increasingly sophisticated functionality yet are cheaper and simpler to manage than current networks.

Save Lives. Join OpenMRS for Google Summer of Code 2013. Thank you for your interest in OpenMRS! OpenMRS has been accepted for the 7th year as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code in 2013. We're enjoyed participating in this great program in the last 6 years and are even more excited about the projects and mentors we have available this year. Coding for OpenMRS is a great way to practice your coding skills and, at the same time, help benefit people in developing countries who are on the front lines of the battle against HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria. The Summer of Code page on our wiki describes potential projects and our mentors this year. These aren't \"busy work\" - we've reviewed our actual project list and identified ones that can be completed by students (advised by our team of excellent mentors) during Summer of Code this year. Why OpenMRS? Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS - most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases ... if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries - a tide which rises all ships. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by Regenstrief Institute, a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health, a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in many countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and many more. This work is supported in part by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Rockefeller Foundation, the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).

Globally, there are teachers that discuss how they use Sugar in their classrooms; students who blog about their Sugar learning experiences; and everyone, not just software engineers, contribute to the code base.

Like a sponge, Sugar pulls in projects such as Gcompris, Etoys, Scratch, and Open Office for Children, as well as hundreds of learning activities specifically written for Sugar, making those great tools available to more children. But the Sugar platform further enhances the learning experience through its mechanisms of collaboration and reflection. With Sugar, the computer represents more than an opportunity for interaction with isolated applications; it is the manifestation of a change in the culture of learning. Sugar will engage even the youngest learner in the use of computation as a powerful \u201cthing to think with.\u201d They will quickly become proficient in using the computer as a tool to engage in authentic problem-solving. Sugar users develop skills that help them in all aspects of life.The Sugar software is a learning platform designed for children, originally designed for the XO laptop of the OLPC project, but completely independent of OLPC since Q1 2008. Sugar installs on most GNU/Linux distros, hence it can run on most netbooks and PCs and on virtual machines in Windows and iOS.

Race underground or in space, watching the stars passing by. Have some rest under the palms on the beach (watching the other karts overtaking you\u00a0:) ). But don't eat the bananas! Watch for bowling balls, plungers, bubble gum and cakes thrown by opponents. You can do a single race against other karts, compete in one of several Grand Prix, try to beat the high score in time trials on your own, play battle mode against your friends, and more!

Our bylaws specifically state any software or papers developed and published by the organization must be licensed as open source and made freely available to the community. Our goal is to help coordinate the development, deployment, advancement and research findings of honeypot related technologies. With over forty international chapters, two hundred and fifty members and thirty open source research projects around around the world, we are a mature, highly diverse and international organization.  Simply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this goal in the following three ways: Awareness We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals and organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information so people can better understand they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This information is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers. Information For those who are already aware and concerned, we provide details to better secure and defend your resources. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our Scan of the Month challenges. Tools For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. We provide these through our Tools Site.

It contains standard protocols (e.g., 6LowPAN, CoAP), algorithms (e.g., localization, routing, time synchronization, clustering), and data structures (e.g., an external-memory lists and sets, an RDF database), that can be compiled for several different platforms. The supported platforms include TinyOS and Contiki, the two major operating systems for sensor-class devices, as well as several device-specific firmwares (iSense, Feuerwhere, TriSOS, etc). The two major handheld OS (Android and iOS) are supported as well. The Wiselib is written in C++. It uses templates and template specialization in the same way as Boost, CGAL, and the STL. This makes it possible to write generic and platform-independent code that is very efficiently compiled for the various platforms. The motivating issue behind the Wiselib is the severe fragmentation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. For sensor nodes, TinyOS dominates the US, and Contiki Europe, hindering exchange of ideas and code. Many IoT scenarios (say, Smart Cities where people can use their handheld to interact with local city services) require connectivity between mobile phones, infrastructure devices, and battery-powered sensors and actors. This requires either programming against a truly platform-independent API (such as the Wiselib), or porting and maintaining code for 5-10 completely different platforms. We provide easy-to-use interfaces to the OS, which simplifies the development process and decreases the need for dealing with low-level functionality of specific hardware platforms.

The project was started by Sam Hart over ten years ago and currently maintains and develops three software programs. The programs take their name from Tux, the Linux mascot. Tux Paint, led by Bill Kendrick, is an award-winning and widely used artistic graphics program. Tux Paint is enjoyable for everyone from the youngest children capable of using computers up through adults. Tux Math (originally written by Bill Kendrick, now led by David Bruce, Tim Holy and Aaditya Maheshwari) is a video game-style math drill program. It covers basic math operations up through topics such as negative numbers, factoring, and order-of-operations exercises. Tux Typing (originally written by Sam Hart, now led by David Bruce) offers word typing practice in the setting of two video game-type activities, as well as phrase and sentence typing for older students. All three programs are SDL-based C apps, licensed under the GPL. They are developed natively on Linux and are included in all major desktop distributions, as well as non-Linux Free Software collections such as the FreeBSD Ports Collection and the MacPorts project for OS-X. Builds are also available for Microsoft Windows and Haiku/BeOS. The aim is to avoid specific platform dependencies so the programs can be made available as widely as possible, including the computing environments that children are most likely to actually encounter in schools. Similarly, all three programs are extensively internationalized using the standard GNU gettext library.

The TYPO3 project has grown from one product to a family of products in 2012. TYPO3 CMS is an enterprise-class Open Source Content Management System built with PHP and has a 10 year development history. Besides the current TYPO3 CMS the TYPO3 community has, in the past years, developed a PHP application framework called Flow. TYPO3 Flow supports features like Dependency Injection and Aspect Oriented Programming. TYPO3 Neos, a new CMS based on Flow, with WYSIWYG on page editing is currently one of the main family members of the TYPO3 family and will be up for a first stable release this year. Because of its Danish origins the majority of the TYPO3 developer community is located in Europe and especially in Germany, but TYPO3 is enjoying a growing popularity in Asia, Africa, and the Americas recently. There are about 500,000 installations of TYPO3 CMS world wide including high profile websites of large companies such as Lufthansa, Volkswagen, T-Online, DHL, 3M, General Electric, and Stanford University and many government sites to name a few. TYPO3 CMS has been downloaded over 7 million times. Highlights of TYPO3 CMS\u2019s feature set are its complete separation of content and design, a fine-grained permission system, a WYSIWYG rich text editor, an integrated versioning and workflow system, frontend / in-site editing, integrated search engine, dynamic navigation menu generation, dynamic graphics generation, standards compliant output and single source publishing, multi-language support, advanced caching system with reverse proxy support, and user registration. In addition an open API enables very versatile options for developing extensions and additional functionality. The main goal of the TYPO3 Association is to support core development of the TYPO3 Open Source Content Management System on a steady basis and to improve the transparency and efficiency of various aspects of the TYPO3 project.", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2013/orgs/typo3/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://wiki.typo3.org/Gsoc2013/Ideas", "name": "TYPO3 Association", "num_projects": 4, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2013},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-l\n   We believe that knowledge should be free for every human being.

Catroid allows kids and teens from age 8 up to easily write Android apps using only their mobile device, without the need for an additional PC. Catroid projects are written in a graphical \u201cLego\u201d-type style as known from Scratch or AppInventor.  Paintroid is part of the Catroid project and is a graphical paint editor for the Android platform that, among others, allows setting parts of pictures to transparent (pinch zoom up to single pixel level), which is an important feature if one wants to extract, e.g., one\u2019s own head from a photograph while deleting all the background, or some other part from any image, in order to use the resulting shape as a graphical element inside one\u2019s app.  Catroid\u2019s Web 2.0 community site allows kids and teens to share their apps in a way similar to Scratch's community site, including the sharing and remixing of Catroid project files under the AGPL license, the aim being to facilitate the learning of programming skills among kids and teens (and also older users).  Typical users of Catroid would be, e.g. an 11 year old girl wanting to share her Hannah Montana animation with her friends, or a 15 year old boy wanting to implement a multi-player multi-touch space invaders game. Thus, usability is a major aspect of the project and is accorded top priority.  The motivation behind the Catroid project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.  The Catroid team released a first public beta in March 2012. There are several subprojects involving, e.g. the bidirectional coupling with an AR.Drone quadcopter, with a Lego Mindstorms robot, with a Robocup soccer robot via the Arduino open-source electronics platform, a program that allows to package a Catroid project as an apk file (i.e., as a stand-alone Android app), an HTML5 player (though not supporting all Catroid features as not all sensors etc can be accessed), a localization / internationalization support site (we currently support several languages, with speakers of English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Arabian, German, Turkish, French, Japanese, Urdu, and Malaysian in the team), and the building of an engaging tutorial game inspired by the funny tutorial of Nintendo\u2019s Wario Ware: D.I.Y. programming game for the Nintendo DS.  The Catroid team currently is composed of more than 70 active developers. We use the test-driven development method (test-first style; tests used as declarative executable program documentation) with several additional practices from extreme programming such as ping pong pair programming in frequently changing pairs, kanban system, very clear self-explaining clean code (including test code; no comments in code unless not expressible in the code itself; no prose documentation), continuous usability consideration (paper prototyping on a daily basis, the personas method, usability expert feedbacks, and usability tests with children), continuous integration using Mercurial on Google Code, automated unit-, functional-, regression-, and monkey-testing, permanent refactoring, the YAGNI principle, and collective code ownership.  External contributors will need to follow our test-driven development method. While we minimize the amount of test code and are very pragmatic, please understand that we are concerned of producing high quality and highly maintainable code that can be extended and refactored without the need for direct human communication and without the need to refer to non-executable documents.", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2012/orgs/catroidproject/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://goo.gl/FD2Sl", "name": "Catroid Project", "num_projects": 8, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2012},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: mailto:sft-gsoc@cern.ch\n   CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) is one of the world\u2019s largest and most exciting centres for fundamental physics research. CERN is also famous for being the place where Tim Berners-Lee \u00a0invented the World Wide Web. Most of the activities at CERN are currently directed towards operating the world\u2019s biggest elementary particle accelerator - the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and running the four largest experiments at the LHC (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb). These seek to expand the frontiers of knowledge and complete our understanding of the constituents of matter and their interactions, of the conditions in the first instants after the Big Bang and of the differences between matter and anti-matter. Fear not! The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.  The CERN Virtual Machine (CernVM) is an R&D project established in the Software group of CERN\u2019s Physics Department (PH/SFT) to investigate how virtualization technologies can be used to improve and simplify the daily interaction of physicists with experiment software frameworks and the Grid infrastructure. CernVM maintains a Virtual Software Appliance designed to provide a complete and portable environment for developing and running LHC data analysis applications on any end user computer (laptop, desktop) as well as on the Grid and on Clouds.  Geant4 is a toolkit for the simulation of the interactions of radiation with material. \u00a0It is used to simulate interactions in the detectors of the LHC and other High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments and in diverse other fields. Examples outside HEP include using it to assess the effects of radiation on the electronics of satellites and to design improved medical detectors with specially designed applications such as GATE. LHC experiments use Geant4 to compare the signatures of events from new physics (such as the Higgs boson and particles which are candidates for dark matter) to the signatures of events coming from known interactions which could mimic them. Geant4 is created by the Geant4 collaboration of 90 physicists and engineers from around the world, spaning teams at leading High Energy Physics laboratories such as CERN (Geneva, Switzerland), Fermilab (Batavia, IL), KEK (Tsukuba, Japan), SLAC (Stanford, CA) and Triumf (Vancouver, Canada), as well as many universities and institutions. The toolkit continues to be developed to improve its precision and scope of application, and to better utilise current and emerging computer architectures. \u00a0 The ROOT system provides a set of OO frameworks with all the functionality needed to handle and analyze large amounts of data in a very efficient way. Having the data defined as a set of objects, specialized storage methods are used to get direct access to the separate attributes of the selected objects, without having to touch the bulk of the data. Included are histograming methods in an arbitrary number of dimensions, curve fitting, function evaluation, minimization, graphics and visualization classes to allow the easy setup of an analysis system that can query and process the data interactively or in batch mode, as well as a general parallel processing framework, PROOF, that can considerably speed up an analysis.", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://sftweb.cern.ch/gsoc12", "name": "CERN SFT", "num_projects": 7, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2012},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: mailto:gsoc-cgal@lists-sop.inria.fr\n   CGAL is a software library that offers a number of reliable geometric data structures and algorithms.

Gephi is a \u201cPhotoshop\u201d for such data: designed to make data navigation and manipulation easy, it covers the entire process from data importing to aesthetics refinements and communication. Users interact with the visualization and manipulate structures, shapes and colors to reveal the properties of complex and messy data. The goal is to help data analysts to make hypotheses and intuitively discover patterns or errors in large data collections. Gephi is built with Java SE 6 on top of the NetBeans Platform, and uses a large number of Java libraries, including JOGL for its 3-D rendering engine.  The strength of Gephi is its usability, performance, and modularity. Modules are loosely coupled, and extensible with plug-ins. Data-centered companies such as LinkedIn, Xerox, Elsevier, and many research laboratories have already used Gephi for visualizing their data.

Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Rope\" or \"Parachute\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. Hedgewars features a variety of different programming languages: with portability in mind: QT and SDL, two of the most used crossplatform are the only dependencies. The main interface is written in C++ and QT and is used for configuring your team and the game option as well as for starting the game. The engine is written in Freepascal, a very compatible Pascal variant, with SDL used for handling the GL context. The server for local LAN and multiplayer is written in Haskell, a very popular functional language. Then each mobile port has its own frontend written in the device native language (ObjC on iOS and Java on Android). An optional dependency is Lua that allows users to write their own missions and game modes, so that the Hedgewars community can get more and more involved in the gameplay development. As said, portability is an important asset for Hedgewars as this game is available for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X on x86, x86_64, PowerPC and ARM, and we are always looking forward to new ports. Hedgewas has been featured twice on Ubuntu Features list (for the 10.04 LTS and 10.10 release [1]) and it has been highlighted in the Top Free applications for the Mac Appstore launch [2].

HelenOS thus provides a computing environment that has several virtues, such as flexibility, increased robustness, well-defined explicit interfaces and reduced complexity as compared to other operating system architectures. HelenOS does not aim to be another clone of Unix or some other legacy operating system and is not POSIX-compliant (even though it may seem POSIX-similar at times). Instead, we try to design it according to our taste and sense for what is the most elegant and right thing to do.

You are welcome to go directly to our ideas page, or to stay on this page to learn about M-Lab and the projects under its umbrella: DONAR and Paris Traceroute Measurement Lab (M-Lab) is an open, distributed server platform for researchers to deploy Internet measurement tools. The goal of M-Lab is to advance network research and empower the public with useful information about their broadband connections. By enhancing Internet transparency, M-Lab helps sustain a healthy, innovative Internet. When an Internet application doesn't work as expected, how can you tell whether the problem is caused by your broadband connection, the application or something else? It can be very difficult for professional network administrators, let alone average Internet users, to answer this sort of question today. Transparency has always been an essential component of the Internet's success, and Internet users deserve to be well-informed about the performance of their broadband connections. For that to happen, researchers need resources to develop new analytical tools. That's where M-Lab comes in. Many researchers are already developing tools that allow users to test their broadband connections by briefly communicating with a server elsewhere on the Internet. The M-Lab platform supports the development of these measurement tools. M-Lab assists scientific research by providing widely-distributed servers and ample connectivity for researchers' use. Each tool will be allocated dedicated resources on the M-Lab platform to facilitate accurate measurements. Server-side tools will be openly licensed and operated to allow third-parties to develop their own client-side measurement software. All data collected via M-Lab will be made available to the research community to allow researchers to build on a common pool of network measurement data. M-Lab is a\u00a0collaborative effort\u00a0led by researchers in partnership with companies and other institutions. Today, M-Lab is only at the beginning of its development. Five tools are currently available, running on 45 servers in 15 locations. In order to achieve our goals, M-Lab depends on the active support of additional partners, and we welcome input from anyone interested in helping the platform flourish. For more information, read this introduction to Measurement Lab and invitation to the research community to get involved, in the June ACM's Computer Communication Review available\u00a0here. If you are an Internet user and want to run the tools,\u00a0check out our Tools page. If you are a company, institution or researcher interested in learning more about using and supporting M-Lab,\u00a0learn more here.

MusicBrainz is a user maintained community music metadatabase. Music metadata is information such as the name of an artist, the name of an album and list of tracks that appear on an album.

This means that anyone - including you - can\u00a0help contribute\u00a0to the project by adding information about your favorite artists and their related works. In 2000, Gracenote took over the free CDDB project and commercialized it, essentially charging users for access to the very data they had themselves contributed. In response, Robert Kaye founded MusicBrainz. The project has since grown rapidly from a one-man operation to an international community of enthusiasts who appreciate both music and music metadata. Along the way, the scope of the project has expanded from its origins as a mere a CDDB replacement to today, where MusicBrainz has become a true encyclopedia of music. As an encyclopedia and as a community, MusicBrainz exists solely to collect as much information about music as we can.

A substantial part of these algorithms and\u00a0data structures are building blocks of graph drawing algorithms, and the \u00a0OGDF aims at providing\u00a0such functionality in a reusable form, thus also providing a powerful platform for implementing new\u00a0algorithms.", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://www.ogdf.net/doku.php/gsoc2012-ideas", "name": "OGDF - Open Graph Drawing Framework", "num_projects": 2, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2012},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=13\n   What Is OGRE? OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for developers to produce applications utilising hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. The class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes. What can it do?Lots of things! See the features page for an up-to-date list of the current features. Also, take a look at the screenshots page to see for yourself the kinds of eye candy OGRE can pump out. Is OGRE A Game Engine?No. OGRE can be (and indeed has been) used to make games, but OGRE is deliberately designed to provide just a world-class graphics solution; for other features like sound, networking, AI, collision, physics etc, you will need to integrate it with other libraries, something several frameworks have done, and we have a collision / physics reference integration library as an example in our distribution. Why? Well, one reason is that not everyone who needs a 3D engine wants to make games, so we don\u2019t assume that you do \u2013 you can use OGRE for games, simulations, business applications, anything at all. Secondly, even within the games industry, requirements can vary widely; for example a MMORPG will need a very different kind of network library than an FPS, and a flight sim will need a different kind of collision / physics system to fighting game. If OGRE included all these features, we would be enforcing a particular set of libraries on you, with an inbuilt set of assumed requirements, and that\u2019s not good design. Instead, we provide a very integration friendly API and let YOU choose the other libraries, if you want them. Many experienced game developers have expressed their approval of this approach, because there are no inbuilt constraints. It can be more daunting for newer users who just want to build another FPS-style game, but for those people there are a growing number of existing frameworks using OGRE which provide a complete solution using a given combo of libraries; but it\u2019s important to realise that OGRE itself will always remain separate, flexible enough to be incorporated into any of these. The principle is of collaboration and integration with other libraries, rather than assimilation of them, a standard tenet of component-based design. Why should I consider using OGRE (rather than the other zillion 3D engines out there)?Many other engines, whilst technically impressive, lack the cohesive design and the consistent documentation to allow them to be used effectively. Many of them have long features lists, but have the feel of a bunch of tech demos lashed together with twine, with no clear vision to hold them together. Like any other software system this becomes their downfall as they become larger. Most other engines are also designed for one particular style of game or demo (e.g. first-person shooters, terrain roamers). OGRE is different. OGRE is design-led rather than feature-led. Every feature that goes into OGRE is considered throughly and slotted into the overall design as elegantly as possible and is always fully documented, meaning that the features which are there always feel part of a cohesive whole. Quality is favoured over quantity, because quantity can come later \u2013 quality can never be added in retrospect. OGRE uses sound design principles learned, tried and tested many times in commercial-grade software \u2013 the object-orientation mentioned in it\u2019s moniker is just one of those approaches \u2013 frequent use of design patterns is another. The core development team is kept deliberately small, and all of its members are veteren software engineers with many years of real-world experience. Patches are welcomed from community, but they undergo a strict review for both quality and cohesion with the Ogre philosophy before being accepted. OGRE does not assume what type of game or demo you want to make. It uses a flexible class hierarchy allowing you to design plugins to specialise the scene organisation approach taken to allow you to make any kind of scene you like. Want to render indoor levels fast? Fine, use the BSP/PVS plugin scene manager which has already been written. Want an outdoor landscape? Again, use another plugin scene manager. The rest of the engine continues to function exactly as before. So the short answer is \u2013 if you favour design quality, flexibility and clear documentation, choose OGRE. You know it makes sense.\u00a0[IMAGE http://www.ogre3d.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif] Is it really free?The Ogre source is made available under the MIT License, which basically means you can use it however you like as long as you include the content of our COPYING file somewhere in your application. The source to your application, or your modifications to Ogre do not have to be released (although it would be nice if you did). See the licensing page for full licensing terms. How do I find out more?If you want to find out about the principles under which OGRE has been developed and to get a quick overview of the design, go to the OGRE Manual now. You can also read the tutorials to help you get started, and then reference the API documentation online. The best way to appreciate OGRE is to use it. I recommend using Mercurial to download the latest version since the code is under constant improvement. If you don\u2019t want to use Mercurial, a snapshot is released periodically for download. For both these options, see the downloads page. If you have any specific questions, just email the project manager using the email address listed on the team page. \u00a0[IMAGE http://bluefilms.fanz.in/fanzin/prd/templates/fanzin/v3/images/play.png]", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2012/orgs/ogre/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/Help+Requested", "name": "OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine)", "num_projects": 3, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2012},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: http://lists.open-bio.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc\n   The OBF is a nonprofit volunteer run organization focused on supporting open source programming in bioinformatics.

Until recently, most lighting equipment has been controlled over a unidirectional RS-485 channel, using the DMX512 standard (written in 1986, revised since and now know as ANSI E1.11 - 2008). The use of a serial link severely limits data rate, and means data distribution products such as wireless links are expensive due to the small market. In the late 1990s, the growing popularity of Ethernet led to some within the industry to consider DMX over IP protocols. By the early 2000s, no less than 6 DMX over IP protocols had been developed, some proprietary and others public. An effort commenced to define an industry standard protocol, but scope creep meant this wasn\u2019t published until 2009. The Open Lighting Project The Open Lighting Project was started in 2004 as a college honors project. The flagship product, OLA (Open Lighting Architecture: http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/Open_Lighting_Architecture) now supports 5 DMX-over-IP protocols. This was initially done by reverse engineering but recently some manufacturers have released the specifications of their proprietary protocols. OLA enables end users to use lighting equipment from different manufacturers on an IP network, freeing customers from vendor lock in.\u00a0 OLA also supports 17 USB to DMX512 adaptors, allowing users to distribute the DMX control information over IP and then convert to traditional DMX512 for legacy devices. OLA also supports ANSI E1.31 (2009), the new standard for DMX over IP. In 2010 we began work on RDM (Remote Device Management: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDM_(lighting) ), a relatively new standard published by ANSI in 2006 which, for the first time, enables bi-directional control of lighting devices. This means that rather than relying on visual inspections, lighting operators can be notified when abnormal conditions such as over heating occur with the lighting devices. RDM is starting to see significant uptake within the industry. Since 2010, we\u2019ve been involved in the standards process for ANSI E1.33, a new protocol for transporting RDM information over IP. OLA is being used as a sandbox to test E1.33, as a way of ensuring the protocol works correctly before the standard is published. In early 2011 we released the Automated RDM Responder Tests (http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/RDM_Responder_Testing), a collection of test cases which can be used to evaluate the quality of RDM enabled lighting hardware. Due to the industry\u2019s small size, many manufacturers do not have mature software engineering processes in place, so much of testing has been manual. The release of an open source automated testing suite was groundbreaking for the industry and the software is now used by the many of the manufacturers as part of their QA process.", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2012/orgs/openlighting/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/OLA_SOC_Ideas_Page", "name": "Open Lighting Project", "num_projects": 1, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2012},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/OpenCV/\n   The Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) is a comprehensive computer vision library and machine learning (over 2500 functions) written in C++ and C with additional Python and Java interfaces.

Save Lives. Join OpenMRS for Google Summer of Code 2012. Thank you for your interest in OpenMRS! OpenMRS has been accepted for the 6th year as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code in 2012. We're enjoyed participating in this great program in the last 5 years and are even more excited about the projects and mentors we have available this year. Coding for OpenMRS is a great way to practice your coding skills and, at the same time, help benefit people in developing countries who are on the front lines of the battle against HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria. The Summer of Code page on our wiki describes potential projects and our mentors this year. These aren't \"busy work\" - we've reviewed our actual project list and identified ones that can be completed by students (advised by our team of excellent mentors) during Summer of Code this year. Why OpenMRS? Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS - most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases ... if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries - a tide which rises all ships. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by Regenstrief Institute, a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health, a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in several developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and many more. This work is supported in part by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Rockefeller Foundation, the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).

A point cloud is a data structure used to represent a collection of multi-dimensional points and is commonly used to represent three-dimensional data such as the output of a stereo camera, 3D scanner, or time-of-flight camera. With the advent of new, low-cost hardware such as the Microsoft Kinect or Asus XTionPro 3D cameras and continued efforts in advanced open source 3D point cloud processing, 3D perception gains more and more importance in many fields. \u00a0 The PCL library contains numerous state-of-the art algorithms including filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting, segmentation, tracking, recognition, and many more. These algorithms can be used, for example, to filter outliers from noisy data, stitch 3D point clouds together, segment relevant parts of a scene, extract keypoints and compute descriptors to recognize objects in the world, and create surfaces from point clouds and visualize them -- to name a few. \u00a0 PCL is released under the terms of the BSD license and is open source software. It is free for commercial and research use. Development of PCL is a large collaborative effort driven by researchers and engineers from many different institutions and companies around the world. PCL is cross-platform, and has been successfully compiled and deployed on Linux, MacOS, Windows, and Android. To simplify development, PCL is split into a series of smaller code libraries, that can be compiled separately. This modularity is important for distributing PCL on platforms with reduced computational or size constraints. PCL aims to be for 3D processing, what the Boost set of libraries are for C++: a collection of fast, modular, and community peer reviewed code libraries that can be used to create powerful and complex applications. PCL is written entirely in C++ and makes use of modern C++ libraries such as Boost and Eigen for all its internal data structures. In order to support applications that require real time point cloud processing, PCL has been designed to take advantage of SSE instructions when available, and a GPU interface is currently under development in association with NVIDIA. \u00a0 The Point Cloud Library aims to unite the field of point cloud processing.

For the past ten years everything we have done and continue to do is based on the principles of opensource and volunteer efforts. Our bylaws specifically state any software or papers developed and published by the organization must be licensed as open source and made freely available to the community. Our goal is to help coordinate the development, deployment, advancement and research findings of honeypot related technologies. With over thirty chapters, one hundred members and twenty opensource research projects around around the world, we are a highly diverse and international organization. Simply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this goal in the following three ways: Awareness We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals and organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information so people can better understand they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This information is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers. Information For those who are already aware and concerned, we provide details to better secure and defend your resources. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our Scan of the Month challenges. Tools For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. We provide these through our Tools Site.

Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can be\u00a0used to build them. LLVM began as a\u00a0research project\u00a0at the\u00a0University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of\u00a0commercial and open sourceprojects as well as being widely used in\u00a0academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under the\u00a0\"UIUC\" BSD-Style license. The primary sub-projects of LLVM are: The\u00a0LLVM Core\u00a0libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent\u00a0optimizer, along with\u00a0code generation support\u00a0for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around a\u00a0well specified\u00a0code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\"). The LLVM Core libraries are\u00a0well documented, and it is particularly easy to invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to use\u00a0LLVM as an optimizer and code generator. Clang\u00a0is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles (e.g. about\u00a03x faster than GCCwhen compiling Objective-C code in a debug configuration), extremely useful\u00a0error and warning messages\u00a0and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The\u00a0Clang Static Analyzer\u00a0is a tool that automatically finds bugs in your code, and is a great example of the sort of tool that can be built using the Clang frontend as a library to parse C/C++ code. dragonegg\u00a0integrates the LLVM optimizers and code generator with the GCC 4.5 parsers. This allows LLVM to compile Ada, Fortran, and other languages supported by the GCC compiler frontends, and access to C features not supported by Clang (such as OpenMP). The\u00a0LLDB\u00a0project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger. It uses the Clang ASTs and expression parser, LLVM JIT, LLVM disassembler, etc so that it provides an experience that \"just works\". It is also blazing fast and much more memory efficient than GDB at loading symbols. The\u00a0libc++\u00a0and\u00a0libc++ ABI\u00a0projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library, including full support for C++'0x. The\u00a0compiler-rt\u00a0project provides highly tuned implementations of the low-level code generator support routines like \"__fixunsdfdi\" and other calls generated when a target doesn't have a short sequence of native instructions to implement a core IR operation. The\u00a0vmkit\u00a0project is an implementation of the Java and .NET Virtual Machines that is built on LLVM technologies. The\u00a0polly\u00a0project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model. The\u00a0libclc\u00a0project aims to implement the OpenCL standard library. The\u00a0klee\u00a0project implements a \"symbolic virtual machine\" which uses a theorem prover to try to evaluate all dynamic paths through a program in an effort to find bugs and to prove properties of functions. A major feature of klee is that it can produce a testcase in the event that it detects a bug. The\u00a0SAFECode\u00a0project is a memory safety compiler for C/C++ programs. It instruments code with run-time checks to detect memory safety errors (e.g., buffer overflows) at run-time. It can be used to protect software from security attacks and can also be used as a memory safety error debugging tool like Valgrind. In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that\u00a0use components of LLVM for various tasks. Through these external projects you can use LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Java, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, and a number of other languages. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers. As much as everything else, LLVM has a broad and friendly community of people who are interested in building great low-level tools. If you are interested in getting involved, a good first place is to skim the\u00a0LLVM Blog\u00a0and to sign up for the\u00a0LLVM Developer mailing list.

Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented.

It is completely written in C++, and uses templates in the same way as Boost and CGAL. This makes it possible to write generic and platform independent code that is very efficiently compiled for the various platforms. In the scope of Google Summer of Code 2012 we give interested and talented students the opportunity to solve interesting problems arising from the application of theoretical algorithms in practice on wireless sensor nodes. Projects around the Wiselib involve working with networked embedded devices, solving diverse challenges w.r.t. inter-node communication and building the groundwork for whole new classes of algorithms. Depending on the problem at hand this means programming on PCs, testbeds of sensor nodes and/or Android or iOS smart phones.", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2012/orgs/wiselib/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://www.wiselib.org/gsoc/", "name": "The Wiselib", "num_projects": 3, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2012},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=Mailing_Lists\n   [IMAGE http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/nfs/project/t/ti/tianocore/7/70/MediaWikiSidebarLogo.png]Our community supports open source code and tools for creating and using UEFI firmware.\u00a0 Our firmware build system is cross platform (Linux, OS X, Windows) and supports various toolchain types (GCC, ICC, Visual Studio, XCode, CLANG).

Astrometry.net is a project and our goal is to allow astronomers of all levels (professional researchers, tech savvy amateurs, and backyard stargazers) to share and learn from each other's astronomical images. A barrier that we are trying to eliminate is the problem of calibrating images -- figuring out the properties of the camera and where it was pointing, so that we can make sense of the image. We have built an \"astrometry engine\" -- a piece of code that can recognize the celestial objects in an astronomical image and figure out where the camera was pointing. You take a picture of the night sky, and our software can automatically figure out where your camera (or telescope) was pointing, based on the geometric arrangement of the stars in the image. It's a computer vision system that *works* -- a cool trick! Exactly what does the astrometry engine produce? A mapping, or transformation, between image coordinates and sky coordinates. Does it work? Yeah! The system can recognize 100% of the 300,000+ images in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We have been running a web service for over three years and have successfully recognized tens of thousands of images.

Catroid allows children from the age of 8 to easily create Android apps using only their mobile device, without the need for an additional PC. Catroid projects are written in a graphical \u201cLego-style\" as known from Scratch or Appinventor. Paintroid is part of the Catroid project and is a graphics painting and editing app for the Android platform. It is used for the creation of elements for Catroid projects. Catroid\u2019s community website http://www.catroid.org/ allows users to share their apps in a way similar to Scratch's community site, including the sharing and remixing of Catroid project files under a creative commons license. Additionally, users can communicate via Catroid\u2019s forums and organize themselves on our children-oriented community Wiki. Typical users of Catroid would be, e.g., an 11 year old girl wanting to share her Hannah Montana animation with her friends, or a 15 year old boy wanting to implement a multi-player, multi-touch space invaders game. Thus, usability is a major aspect of the project and is accorded top priority. The motivation behind the Catroid project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program with children all over the world from an early age on in a fun and engaging way. The Catroid team has released an alpha version at the end of 2010. A first public beta release is planned for the end of October 2011. There are several subprojects involving, e.g., the bidirectional coupling with an AR.Drone quadcopter, with a Lego Mindstorm robot, with a robocup soccer robot via the Arduino open-source electronics platform, a program that allows to package a Catroid project as an apk file (i.e., as a stand-alone Android app), an HTML5 player (though not supporting all Catroid features as not all sensors etc can be accessed), a localization / internationalization support site (we currently support several languages, with speakers of English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Arabian, German, Turkish, French, Japanese, Urdu, and Malaysian in the team), and the building of an engaging tutorial game inspired by the funny tutorial of Nintendo\u2019s Wario Ware: D.I.Y. programming game for the Nintendo DS. The Catroid team currently is composed of more than 25 active developers. Now, since 25 sounds a lot, let us add that so far we worked for the most part closely together as we have a large common room (20 work places) at Graz University of Technology here in Austria which we can use 100% for our project, with 6 large magnetic whiteboards and a flip chart in the room. Also, we use the test-driven development method (test-first style; tests used as declarative executable program documentation) with several additional practices from extreme programming such as pair programming in frequently changing pairs, handwritten user stories on white boards, project velocity based planning, very clear self-explaining clean code (including test code; no comments in code unless not expressible in the code itself; no prose documentation), continuous usability consideration (paper prototyping on a daily basis, the personas method, usability expert feedbacks, and, less frequently, usability tests with real children), continuous integration using Mercurial on Google Code, automated unit-, functional-, regression-, and monkey-testing, permanent refactoring, the YAGNI principle, and collective code ownership. External contributors at the very least will need to follow our test-driven development method. While we minimize the amount of test code and are very pragmatic, please understand that we are concerned of producing highest quality and highly maintainable code that can be extended and refactored without the need for direct human communication and without the need to refer to non-executable documents.

In view of this, we rely on high quality literary content to provide entertainment and emotional investment as well as educational benefits. FreedroidRPG is an open source sci-fi isometric role playing game. It strives at providing an immersive ambience backed by refined graphics and music tracks. Besides the hack'n'slash action phases, dialogs with dozens of characters take care of storytelling. The player can fight with melee or ranged weapons, take control of his enemies by hacking, and remotely execute code on enemy robots. We have a storyline strong enough to be appealing to people who are more after roleplaying than hack'n'slash. The development team is currently made of around six people - four coders, and two people taking care of game content, and we get many contributions from other people, for a total of about 10 people active at a given time.

Designed to make data navigation and manipulation easy, it covers the entire process from data importing to aesthetics refinements and interaction. Users interact with the visualization and manipulate structures, shapes and colors to reveal hidden properties. The goal is to help data analysts to make hypotheses and intuitively discover patterns or errors in large data collections.

The strength of Gephi is its usability, performance, and modularity. Modules are loosely coupled, and extensible with plug-ins. Data-centered companies such as LinkedIn, Xerox, Elsevier, and many academics like the Indiana University or the library of Stanford University have already used Gephi for visualizing their data.

Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Rope\" or \"Parachute\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. Hedgewars features a variety of different programming languages: with portability in mind: QT and SDL, two of the most used crossplatform are the only dependencies. The main interface is written in C++ and QT and is used for configuring your team and the game option as well as for starting the game. The engine is written in Freepascal, a very compatible Pascal variant, with SDL used for handling the GL context. The server for local LAN and multiplayer is written in Haskell, a very popular imperative language. An optional dependency is Lua that allows users to write their own missions and game modes, so that the Hedgewars community can get more and more involved in the gameplay development. As said, portability is an important asset for Hedgewars as this game is available for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X on x86, x86_64, PowerPC and ARM, and we are always looking forward to new ports. Hedgewas has been featured twice on Ubuntu Features list (for the 10.04 LTS and 10.10 release [1]) and it has been highlighted in the Top Free applications for the Mac Appstore launch [2].

This is a great opportunity to work at the intersection of biology and computing. GenMAPP is a pathway visualization and analysis tool for biological data. GenMAPP illustrates the relationships between various genes and proteins to help researchers understand their data in terms of connected, biological pathways. Tens of thousands of people from a hundred countries have registered to download the GenMAPP program. The GenMAPP group is coordinated by the Conklin Lab at the Gladstone Institutes (UCSF). Our development team is composed of biologists and programmers, providing a unique perspective on building and using open source tools. Cytoscape is a general network visualization tool that integrates network topology with data about the network into the visualization. Cytoscape is rapidly becoming a systems biology standard. Cytoscape consists of a plugin framework which extends functionality in new ways. Our team consists of programmers and biologists from both academia and industry including: UC San Diego, UC San Francisco, U of Toronto, Agilent, Institute for Systems Biology, Sloan-Kettering, Institut Pasteur and others. WikiPathways is a wiki for biological pathways. The wiki approach allows biologists and domain experts to easily create and update pathways. Pathways can be directly modified from a web browser using an embedded applet where you can draw genes, proteins and their interactions like in any popular drawing tool. The pathways can be used as images for publication and in data analysis tools such as GenMAPP, PathVisio and Cytoscape. WikiPathways itself is completely open source and is built on top of MediaWiki, using PathVisio as the pathway editor and BridgeDb as the backend database.

We offer a collaborative environment for scientists that are interested in learning and developing modern Human/Computer Interaction methods and concepts. Our research includes topics such as: computer vision, touch computing, voice & gesture recognition, and experience design and information visualization. We have participated in every GSoC event since 2008. Natural User Interfaces are becoming common in our everyday lives. Companies are rapidly introducing new product lines with NUI methodologies interwoven within; Google, Samsung, Apple, Microsoft and others\u2026 all with a major push towards enhanced interaction. The class most influenced by the emergence so far is the \u201csmart mobile\u201d as each unit contains 5-10 sensors paired with rich effectors. With 2011 seeming to be the year of the tablet both touch computing and our understanding of UX must scale once again as Android has shown with Fragments. Moving beyond mobile applications, entertainment devices like the Xbox Kinect Sensor give us new sensing abilities which officially registers on Windows 7 as NUI Audio, NUI Camera and NUI Motor devices, hinting towards the future. By participating in GSoC, we would like to expand the NUI concepts to a wider audience, raising interest from students around the world that do not typically have the opportunity to work with such technologies. We aim to study emerging sensing solutions and translate to applicable scenarios, starting with computer vision, natural language, and signal processing. Beyond that students can ponder on innovative problems that include related developments in clustering algorithms, image processing and machine learning. With over 12,000 members, our goals is to accelerate the exploration of sensing solutions and interaction scenarios, thus allowing us to find the most effective methods of constructing modern interface devices. Our members are a worldwide gathering of students, researchers, designers, developers and engineers all who share a similar passion for the creation and distribution of open systems. An important aspect is to create and utilize open standards that allow development to flourish. An example is our Community Core Vision or CCV project which is built in OpenFrameworks and supports several communications modes (Binary, TUIO, OSC and XML). The project is nearing one million total downloads and has introduced computer vision to a whole new audience, lowering the entry bar for new researchers while remaining powerful for advanced use and content creators. We would like to thank Google Summer of Code Project and the amazing contributors for making this a possible.

Save Lives. Join OpenMRS for Google Summer of Code 2011. Thank you for your interest in OpenMRS! OpenMRS has been accepted for the 5th year as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code in 2011. We're enjoyed participating in this great program in the last 4 years and are even more excited about the projects and mentors we have available this year. Coding for OpenMRS is a great way to practice your coding skills and, at the same time, help benefit people in developing countries who are on the front lines of the battle against HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria. The Summer of Code page on our wiki describes potential projects and our mentors this year. These aren't \"busy work\" - we've reviewed our actual project list and identified ones that can be completed by students (advised by our team of excellent mentors) during Summer of Code this year. Why OpenMRS? Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS - most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases ... if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries - a tide which rises all ships. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by Regenstrief Institute, a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health, a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in several developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and many more. This work is supported in part by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Rockefeller Foundation, the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).

A point cloud is a data structure used to represent a collection of multi-dimensional points and is commonly used to represent three-dimensional data such as the output of a stereo camera, 3D scanner, or time-of-flight camera. The library contains numerous state-of-the art algorithms including filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation. These algorithms can be used, for example, to filter outliers from noisy data, stitch 3D point clouds together, segment relevant parts of a scene, extract keypoints and compute descriptors to recognize objects in the world based on their geometric appearance, and create surfaces from point clouds and visualize them --- to name a few. PCL is released under the terms of the BSD license and is open source software. It is free for commercial and research use. Development of PCL is a large collaborative effort driven by researchers and engineers from many different institutions and companies around the world, including: AIST, UC Berkeley, University of Bonn, University of British Columbia, ETH Zurich, University of Freiburg, Intel Research Seattle, ITSeez, LAAS/CNRS, MIT, NVidia, Stanford University, TU Munich, University of Tokyo, Willow Garage, TU Wien, and WUSTL. The use of PCL is instrumental for robotics applications, and with the advent of new, low-cost hardware such as Kinect-like sensors, PCL places a lot of functionality in the hands of end-users and developers all around the world that need to do something useful with their 3D data. The library is written entirely in C++ and makes use of Boost shared pointers for all its internal data structures. In order to support applications that require real time point cloud processing, PCL has been designed to take advantage of SSE instructions when available, and a GPU interface is currently under development in association with NVIDIA. Just as OpenCV has united the field of Computer Vision and 2D perception, the Point Cloud Library aims to unite the field of point cloud processing. By providing an extensible framework for all the geometric algorithms necessary for 3D perception, PCL enables developers to create applications limited by their imaginations, rather than their 3D geometric knowledge.

It has been in development since 2001 and receives new features, tweaks and fixes every day to provide you with the best possible music listening experience. Rockbox aims to be considerably more functional and efficient than your device's stock firmware while remaining easy to use and customizable. It is a goal to not only offer a wide range of functionality, but where possible make sure that this functionality is presented in a consistent manner that is easy to learn and use. Rockbox runs on a wide range of platforms including devices from Archos, Apple (iPod), iriver, Cowon, Olympus, Toshiba and SanDisk with more in development. The development team consists of over 50 active committers and nearly 600 individual contributors. See http://www.rockbox.org/wiki/WhyRockbox for more information. Thanks to previous Google Summer of Code projects, Rockbox is staying relevant with the changes in digital audio listening. The \"Rockbox as an App\" movement began, to provide the same freedom in audio tasks as we have for years past in dedicated digital audio players. This movement has been successful, and Rockbox now runs as an application on multiple smartphone platforms. We have large userbases in the blind community as well. Since Rockbox has a spoken interface, it has provided them with the ability to navigate and listen to their audio on the go. Audiophile users use Rockbox for its many \"tweaks\" that can be done to audio, to say nothing of our massive audio codec support. Open source and freedom lovers enjoy the ability to make their devices do whatever they wish it to do, as well as get away from many proprietary and closed formats. Rockbox also has developed the most comprehensive collection of open source, fixed point and ARM optimized audio decoders in existence. Our project has optimized more than 30 open source decoders for minimum memory requirements and very high power efficiency on embedded devices. Additionally, we have developed several new fixed point decoders which have been incorporated into libraries such as ffmpeg and VLC, and into mobile phone applications. Working on Rockbox provides several opportunities that can not easily be found elsewhere. There is work close to the hardware, possibly involving reverse engineering. Other people may prefer working on audio codecs - either porting existing code to work in rockbox using only fixed point calculations, or optimising codecs that are already supported. Students who want to improve their SCSI or USB knowledge and skills can do so. All of this, and much more, is done within the constraints and challenges of embedded systems. There is a very active development community, with people who are very knowledgeable in each of these fields and more ready to help others work and learn.", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2011/orgs/rockbox/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://www.rockbox.org/wiki/SummerOfCode2011", "name": "Rockbox", "num_projects": 2, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2011},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: http://www.rtems.org/mailman/listinfo/rtems-users\n   [IMAGE http://www.rtems.org/sites/default/files/logo.png] RTEMS (Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems) is a free real-time operating system designed for deeply embedded systems. The systems RTEMS is designed to execute on are not the general purpose PCs and Macs you are familiar with. The usual target for RTEMS is specially designed computers inside devices -- although RTEMS does support PC hardware which is also commonly embedded. Embedded systems are preprogrammed to perform a narrow range of functions with minimal end user or operator intervention. For example, an automobile's electronic fuel injection system and robotic controllers are examples of embedded systems. RTEMS is a free open source solution that supports multi-processor systems and has been ported to over a dozen CPU architectures and includes support for over 100 boards. In addition, RTEMS is designed to support embedded applications with the most stringent real-time requirements while being compatible with open standards such as POSIX. RTEMS includes optional functional features such as TCP/IP and various file systems while still offering minimum executable sizes under 20 KB in useful configurations. The RTEMS Project is the collection of individuals, companies, universities, and research institutions that collectively maintain and enhance the RTEMS software base.

Our bylaws specifically state any software or papers developed and published by the organization must be licensed as open source and made freely available to the community. Our goal is to help coordinate the development, deployment, advancement and research findings of honeypot related technologies. With over thirty chapters, one hundred members and twenty opensource research projects around around the world, we are a highly diverse and international organization. Simply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this goal in the following three ways: Awareness We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals and organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information so people can better understand they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This information is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers. Information For those who are already aware and concerned, we provide details to better secure and defend your resources. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our Scan of the Month challenges.

If you want to find out more, take a look at our project ideas web page, subscribe to our blog and public GSoC questions mailing list come and say hello on the #gsoc2011-honeynet IRC channel on irc.freenode.net (you can connect via webchat if you are behind a firewall or don't have a command line client too). There should be a mix of organisational admins, project mentors, past successful GSoC students, general Honeynet Project members and prospective students, so feel free to ask questions and we will always try and get back to you. If you are new to IRC, try reading an online primer but don't be worried, we'll be happy to help you get up to speed.

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects ever. JPF is a highly extensible Java Virtual Machine (JVM) written in Java itself, and is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has serious contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities world-wide. The JPF team for GSoC 2011 is led by the NASA Ames Research Center, but includes mentors from UIUC, NCSU, University of Texas, Brigham Young University and the universities of Stellenbosch SA, Tokyo JP and Prague CZ. JPF is designed to be extensible. There are well defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that is the one-stop for learning about, obtaining and contributing to JPF. As JPF has matured in its ability to perform verification on traditional Java programs, we in the process of extending JPF to verify software running on mobile devices. Given that Android is one of the largest open-source framework for mobile computing, we are extending JPF to specifically verify Android applications and the also the Android operating systems.", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2011/orgs/javapathfinder/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf/wiki/events/soc2011", "name": "The Java Pathfinder Team", "num_projects": 11, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2011},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/gsoc/google-summer-code-2011\n   The Linux Foundation is a nonprofit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux.

Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can be\u00a0used to build them. LLVM began as a\u00a0research project\u00a0at the\u00a0University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of\u00a0commercial and open source\u00a0projects as well as being widely used in\u00a0academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under the\u00a0\"UIUC\" BSD-Style license. The primary sub-projects of LLVM are: The\u00a0LLVM Core\u00a0libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent\u00a0optimizer, along with\u00a0code generation support\u00a0for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around a\u00a0well specified\u00a0code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\"). The LLVM Core libraries are\u00a0well documented, and it is particularly easy to invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to use\u00a0LLVM as an optimizer and code generator. Clang\u00a0is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles (e.g. about\u00a03x faster than GCC\u00a0when compiling Objective-C code in a debug configuration), extremely useful\u00a0error and warning messages\u00a0and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The\u00a0Clang Static Analyzeris a tool automatically finds bugs in your code, and is a great example of the sort of tool that can be built using the Clang frontend as a library to parse C/C++ code. dragonegg\u00a0and\u00a0llvm-gcc 4.2\u00a0integrate the LLVM optimizers and code generator with the GCC 4.5 (which is GPL3) and GCC 4.2 (which is GPL2) parsers, respectively. This allows LLVM to compile Ada, Fortran, and other languages supported by the GCC compiler frontends, and provides high-fidelity drop-in compatibility with their respective versions of GCC. The\u00a0LLDB\u00a0project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger. It uses the Clang ASTs and expression parser, LLVM JIT, LLVM disassembler, etc so that it provides an experience that \"just works\". It is also blazing fast and much more memory efficient than GDB at loading symbols. The\u00a0libc++\u00a0project provides a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library, with an aim of supporting C++'0x when the standard is ratified. The\u00a0compiler-rt\u00a0project provides highly tuned implementations of the low-level code generator support routines like \"__fixunsdfdi\" and other calls generated when a target doesn't have a short sequence of native instructions to implement a core IR operation. The\u00a0vmkit\u00a0project is an implementation of the Java and .NET Virtual Machines that is built on LLVM technologies. The\u00a0klee\u00a0project implements a \"symbolic virtual machine\" which uses a theorem prover to try to evaluate all dynamic paths through a program, in an effort to find bugs and to prove properties of functions. A major feature of klee is that it can produce a testcase in the event that it detects a bug. In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that\u00a0use components of LLVM for various tasks. Through these external projects you can use LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Java, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, and a number of other languages. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers. As much as everything else, LLVM has a broad and friendly community of people who are interested in building great low-level tools. If you are interested in getting involved, a good first place is to skim the\u00a0LLVM Blog\u00a0and to sign up for the\u00a0LLVM Developer mailing list.", "logo": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2011/orgs/llvm/logo-200.png", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://llvm.org/OpenProjects.html", "name": "The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure", "num_projects": 7, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2011},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/macports-dev\n   MacPorts is a ports collection and packaging system for Mac OS X.

Besides that the initiative supports communities developing know-how to set up their own networks. Freifunk is applying as an umbrella organization for Google Summer of Code. The freifunk community is acting as an entry point to a network of projects developing tools for mesh networks including the Freifunk Firmware and OpenWrt projects, routing protocols such as OLSR and B.A.T.M.A.N., tools like Maps for networks (e.g. freimap), scanning tools like the horst tool and many more. Recently people also started to develop Open Hardware like the Mesh Potato for villagetelco. With the freifunk firmware it is relatively easy to bring up new wireless mesh networks using ad-hoc WLAN communication layer 2 and layer 3 routing with OLSR, BATMAN and other protocols. Originated in Germany, Freifunk has been deployed successfully in many countries. The OLPC project in Afghanistan uses freifunk for its mesh deployments to distribute digital books, news and educational media. In Ghana freifunk is used to bridge the digital divide in villages. In Vietnam freifunk is used to offer Internet connections at Free and Open Source events like FOSSASIA. In Europe and the Americas city and village networks lower costs for communities and small and medium sized companies, that share common Internet connections, ADSL, Telephone or Satellite uplinks in remote regions. The Freifunk Firmware is a modified version of OpenWrt Linux Version that is developed for router devices. The main aim of the firmware is to make it easier and faster to set up wireless mesh networks. Designed as an embedded Linux for low powered network devices the system can be adapted for a wide variety of devices. Freifunk/OpenWrt supports ad-hoc WLAN communication and layer 2 and 3 routing. Open Source routing protocols can be installed via package updates. Most common protocols are the OLSR protocol and the BATMAN routing protocol. By building the Freifunk embedded firmware together with the OpenWrt team the community is developing an easy to use self-configuring, self-fixing and self-tuning mesh network\u00a0 (http://wiki.openwrt.org/Freifunk). The Freifunk firmware allows anyone to relatively easily build mesh networks of routers.\u00a0 Such networks can be surprisingly scalable involving hundreds / thousands of nodes and made using normal off the shelf routers. Current test version on SVN (https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/GetSource) are enabling developers to create plugins for the firmware. These plugins will enable users to offer locations based services, local search, router CMS, local fm radio distribution via routers, and many more. An example for locations based services is Apple Bonjour that offers users to share their music in local wifi networks, however, in Freifunk mesh networks, there are many more ways to share and communicate as services are build on open standards and open source software. Another project where we are connecting services is the Villagetelco project, where we adapt the firmware to offer telephone services over an adhoc network (www.villagetelco.org). Going in another direction the community also engages to port applications and desktop environments such as LXDE to OpenWrt for Freifunk clouds to offer faster devices with an X interface and making use of thousands of available applications. The porting of code from Google Android also aims to support the adaptability of the Firmware for special use cases.

Today, GeoGebra is available in 50 languages and used by millions of students and teachers from elementary school up to university level in 190 countries world-wide.  The software facilitates the creation of mathematical constructions and models by students that allow interactive explorations by dragging objects and changing parameters. Furthermore, GeoGebra is also an authoring tool that allows teachers to create interactive web-pages. On the GeoGebraWiki (http://www.geogebra.org/wiki), our users have already shared tens of thousands of free learning objects that can be modified and adapted to specific local or individual needs.

LLVM supports effective optimization at compile time, link-time (particularly interprocedural), run-time and offline (i.e., after software is installed), while remaining transparent to developers and maintaining compatibility with existing build scripts. A virtual instruction set\u00a0- LLVM is a low-level object code representation that uses simple RISC-like instructions, but provides rich, language-independent, type information and dataflow (SSA) information about operands. This combination enables sophisticated transformations on object code, while remaining light-weight enough to be attached to the executable. This combination is key to allowing link-time, run-time, and offline transformations. A compiler infrastructure\u00a0- LLVM is also a collection of source code that implements the language and compilation strategy. The primary components of the LLVM infrastructure are a GCC-based\u00a0C & C++ front-end, a link-time optimization framework with a growing set of global and interprocedural analyses and transformations, static back-ends for the X86, X86-64, PowerPC 32/64, ARM, Thumb, IA-64, Alpha, SPARC, MIPS and CellSPU architectures, a back-end which emits portable C code, and a Just-In-Time compiler for X86, X86-64, PowerPC 32/64 processors, and an emitter for MSIL. LLVM does\u00a0not\u00a0imply things that you would expect from a high-level virtual machine. It does not require garbage collection or run-time code generation (In fact, LLVM makes a great static compiler!). Note that optional LLVM components can be used to\u00a0build\u00a0high-level virtual machines and other systems that need these services. \n \n LLVM is a robust system, particularly well suited for developing new mid-level\u00a0language-independent analyses and optimizations\u00a0of all sorts, including those that require\u00a0extensive interprocedural analysis. LLVM is also a great target forfront-end development\u00a0for conventional or research programming languages, including those which require\u00a0compile-time, link-time, or run-time optimization\u00a0for effective implementation, proper tail calls or garbage collection. We have an incomplete\u00a0list of projects\u00a0which have used LLVM for various purposes, showing that you can get up-and-running quickly with LLVM, giving time to do interesting things, even if you only have a semester in a University course.

OpenCV's deployed uses span the range from stitching streetview images together, detecting intrusions in surveillance video in Israel, monitoring mine equipment in China (more notoriously, OpenCV is a key part of China's \"Green Dam\" internet filtering software ), helping robots navigate and pick up objects at Willowgarage, detection swimming pool drowning events in Europe, running interactive art in Spain and New York, checking run ways for derbies in Turkey, inspecting labels on products in factories around the world on to rapid face detection in Japan.

There are over 500 algorithms and about 10 times as many functions that compose or support those algorithms. OpenCV is written natively in C++ and has a templated interface that works seamlessly with std containers. Its native data type is a general matrix class that reference counts and leverages LAPACK and (in April) EIGEN. OpenCV also has a full custom Python interface and, using SWIG, OpenCV has interfaces to Matlab and Octave. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. To enable this, OpenCV has a BSD license to make it easy for businesses to use and modify the code. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You may track weekly meetings at: \u00a0 http://pr.willowgarage.com/wiki/OpenCVMeetingNotes", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/GSOC_OpenCV2010", "name": "Open Source Computer Vision Library", "num_projects": 8, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2010},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: http://lists.openafs.org/mailman/listinfo/openafs-devel\n   OpenAFS is a 100% open source globally distributed file system derived from IBM AFS commercial offering as of 1 November 2000.

OpenMRS has been accepted for the 4th year as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code\u2122 in 2010. We're enjoyed participating in this great program in the last 3 years and are even more excited about the projects and mentors we have available this year. Coding for OpenMRS is a great way to practice your coding skills and, at the same time, help benefit people in developing countries who are on the front lines of the battle against HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria. \n See the OpenMRS Projects page for available projects and their descriptions. These aren't \"busy work\" - we've reviewed our actual project list and identified ones that can be completed by students (advised by our team of excellent mentors) during Summer of Code this year.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers.  Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases ... if anything at all.  To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. \n As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries \u2014 a tide which rises all ships. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by Regenstrief Institute, a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health, a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy.  These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments.  To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in several African countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, and Tanzania.  This work is supported in part by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), The Rockefeller Foundation, and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). \n Take a look at our project ideas and the Developer How-To Guide.

The website was used to map incidents of violence and peace efforts throughout the country based on reports submitted via the web and mobile phone.

User-generated content is becoming an increasingly important source of information during emergency events while traditional media continues to play a pivotal role in documenting events as they unfold. These trends are expected to continue well into the future. The challenge, then, becomes filtering this growing torrent of information. There is an apparent tradeoff between crowdsourcing (opening the floodgates) and validation (the filter). One of the strengths of crowdsourcing is the ability to collect a high volume of information from highly diverse channels like Twitter, email, news sites, blogs, and SMS.  Swift acts as the verifying filter for these different channels and is possible precisely because of the volume of information available from these sources.

A render engine consists of a \"faceless\" computer program that interacts with a host 3D application to provide raytracing capabilities on demand. The YafaRay engine is intended as a free open source alternative to known proprietary engines such as Vray or MentalRay.   The YafaRay project was started in 2001 by Alejandro Conty Est\u00e9vez. By general request from the Blender Community, YafaRay was added as a Blender plugin in August 2004. YafaRay was rewritten from scratch in 2006 by Mathias Wein to allow for new modern features.

It performs just a little bit of hardware initialization and then executes a so-called payload.  Some of the many possible payloads are: a Linux kernel, FILO, GRUB2, OpenBIOS, Open Firmware, SmartFirmware, GNUFI (UEFI), Etherboot, SeaBIOS (for booting Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, NetBSD and Linux), ADLO (for booting Windows 2000 and OpenBSD), Plan 9, or memtest86. The initial motivation for the project was maintenance of large clusters, but unsurprisingly, interest and contributions have come from people with varying backgrounds. The latest version of coreboot can be used in a wide variety of scenarios including clusters, embedded systems, desktop PCs, servers, and more. Why do we need coreboot for cluster maintainance?  Current PCs used as cluster nodes depend on a vendor-supplied BIOS for booting. The BIOS in turn relies on inherently unreliable devices such as floppy disks and hard drives to boot the operating system. In addition, current BIOS software is unable to accommodate non-standard hardware making it difficult to support experimental work. The BIOS is slow and often erroneous and redundant and, most importantly, maintenance is a nightmare. Imagine walking around with a keyboard and monitor to every one of the 1024 nodes in a cluster to change one BIOS setting. coreboot with Linux as a payload (other payloads are possible!) decompresses the Linux kernel straight out of Flash and essentially requires no moving parts (other than maybe a fan). It does a minimal amount of hardware initialization before jumping to the kernel start and lets Linux do the rest. As a result, it is much faster (current record 3 seconds), which has sparked interest in the consumer electronics community as well. Moreover, updates can be performed over the network.  Using a real operating system to boot another operating system provides much greater flexibility than using a simple netboot program or the BIOS. Because Linux is the boot mechanism, it can boot over standard Ethernet or over other interconnects such as Myrinet, Quadrics, or SCI. It can use SSH connections to load the kernel, or it can use the InterMezzo caching file system or traditional NFS. Cluster nodes can be as simple as they need to be \u2013 perhaps as simple as a CPU and memory, no disk, no floppy, and no file system. The nodes will be much less autonomous thus making them easier to maintain. Some aspects of DRM are not travelling well with the idea of a free computer system.

Freifunk Linux Firmwares based on OpenWrt are running on thousands of routers worldwide. Commercially adapted versions are used in hundred of thousands of devices. It is the goal of Freifunk to make it easy to set up local wireless networks with local services. Freifunk meaning free wireless is the pendant to free and open source software or freely licensed content. The tools used in Freifunk networks are exclusively open source. Open source mesh networks are more cost efficient and offer new usage cases (local content sharing, local fm radio networks, sensor networks, distant visual observation etc.) and business opportunities. Freifunk is comparable to an open digital space like public streets and parks. Freifunk software tools and firmwares are available in different \u00a8flavours\u00a8 adapted to local conditions and policies of communities and local ISPs (for example a business man in a small town, who sets up a mesh network for his community and gets paid for providing Internet, whereas local exchange inside the network is freely available). The Freifunk community encompasses people working on open source software, open hardware, the actual set up of infrastructures and freely licensed content. -- FREIFUNK SUMMER OF CODE -- Freifunk is participating in the Google Summer of Code as an umbrella organisation bringing together different projects in the free network community. We are encouraging students to apply with any project related to open wireless infrastructures and specifically mesh networks. What do we need to establish a mesh network? What makes it easier to set up and administer a local network? What is a missing feature or application? What else do we need to set up mesh networks in regions in Asia and Africa where the Internet is not yet available? Ask yourself these question and please talk us about your ideas. -- SUMMER OF CODE AND FREIFUNK COOPERATION WITH UNIVERSITIES -- The Freifunk community has established relations to universities and educational institutions. We are able to offer ECTS credits for many projects in the summer of code through the TU Berlin (see Ideas Page for details http://wiki.freifunk.net/Ideas). Please check with your university for specific conditions for acceptance of credits. -- FREIFUNK FIRMWARES-- The embedded Freifunk Firmwares (operating system) are specially adapted OpenWrt Linux Versions that are developed for routers and mobile devices. The firmwares are particularly lightweight and use less resources compared to other systems. They run on devices with minimal hardware specifications and work well on extremely low powered devices thus can be used in environments with limited energy resources. Main features of Freifunk Firmwares are a common web interface and pre-installed mesh routing protocols. There are different versions available that are customized versions of Freifunk OpenWrt developed by local groups and adapted to local needs and conditions. For example a large city network has different needs than a small Freifunk network in a mountainous village. The firmwares offer common features and can be extended through plugins. The original Freifunk Firmware is developed by Sven-Ola since 2003. Many others have joined since then. The main aim of the firmwares is to make it easier and faster to set up wireless networks, and particularly mesh networks. Installation, customization and administration of OpenWRT for normal users is much easier with Freifunk Firmwares as it provides a prebuild Linux version with OLSR daemon and a web based user interface. -- LOW POWERED DEVICES -- Freifunk Firmwares are designed as embedded Linux\u00b4 for low powered devices and tools. The firmwares can be adapted for a wide variety of local as well as mobile devices. -- A STRONG COMMUNITY AND MANY COMMERCIAL USERS -- The Freifunk firmwares are being used in wireless mesh networks around the world with the biggest ones reaching more than 700 nodes in cities like Berlin or Leipzig. Commercially adapted versions are included on hundreds of thousands of routers of companies like FON.com (main investor Google) and Open-Mesh.com. The firmware is currently gaining popularity with local ISPs in developing countries such as China, India and South Africa, as it is easily adaptable to local needs. Teams of our community are also working on combining advantages of projects like Android and OpenWrt by sharing code. -- WLAN/Wifi COMMUNICATION -- Freifunk/OpenWrt supports ad-hoc WLAN communication and layer 2 and 3 routing with the OLSR protocol and the BATMAN routing protocol. By building the Freifunk embedded firmware together with the OpenWrt team we are developing an easy to use self-configuring, self-fixing and self-tuning mesh network (http://wiki.openwrt.org/Freifunk). -- PLUGINS -- Current test versions on SVN (https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/GetSource) are enabling developers to create plugins for the firmware. These plugins will enable users to offer locations based services, local search, router CMS, local fm radio distribution via routers, and many more. An example for locations based services is Apple Bonjour that offers users to share their music in local wifi networks, however, in Freifunk mesh networks, there are many more ways to share and communicate as services are build on open standards and open source software. -- LOCAL SERVICES -- WLAN Telephones for local and regional phone companies - this is another project where we are connecting services for more cost efficient communication: The Villagetelco project. The goal is to adapt the firmware to offer telephone services over an adhoc network (www.villagetelco.org). -- ADAPTING THE FIRMWARES -- Going in another direction the community also engages to port applications and desktop environments such as LXDE (http://lxde.org) to OpenWrt for Freifunk clouds to offer faster devices with an X interface and making use of thousands of available applications. The porting of code from Google Android also aims to support the adaptability of the Firmware for special use cases. -- COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD -- The development of the Freifunk Firmwares is supported by the freifunk.net initiative. Freifunk.net also supports the set up of networks and educates the public and politicians about open standards and free frequencies.

Our developers span the earth from Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. The project is translated into 50 different languages, and is designed to operate multi-lingual surveys. It\u2019s borderless in both usage and development. The high usage rates are evidence of our strong feature comparison to closed source commercial applications.

In recent years (notably since the Linux kernel project started looking for a new VCS), DVCSs have rapidly started to gain traction. For open source projects, especially, the use of a distributed system can be a great enabler, in that it's much easier to keep track of your own changes and publish them back to the community in a structured way. With centralized systems, you have a central repository that only a happy few have (write) access to, and people spend a lot of time mailing around diffs. With distributed systems, everyone has their own branch, and it's very easy to publish it on the web, compare the changes to those on some other branch or merge two branches back together. This has worked especially well since good DVCS hosting providers have come into being, like GitHub and Bitbucket.  Written largely in Python (with the exceptions of a few performance-critical core modules), it is easy to develop for and allows for good code organization and clean abstractions. Moreover, it has been optimized from the start for good performance, using an append-only datastore, minimizing random disk access and smart uses of compression.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers.  Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all.  To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts.  As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by Regenstrief Institute, Inc.

The development team works either by reverse engineering game executables (usually with the permission of creators of the game), or by using the original source code of the games provided by the creators. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems. Besides running on all mainstream desktop environments, namely Windows, Mac OS X and most Unix variants (Linux, *BSD, Solaris), ScummVM also runs on popular game consoles (Wii, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and more), smart phones and PDAs (WinCE, PalmOS, iPhone or Symbian based), and even on many not-so-mainstream systems (like BeOS, AmigaOS or OS/2). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 65), working together on a codebase almost 800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.

To achieve this freedom, the network is entirely decentralized and publishers and consumers of information are anonymous. Without anonymity there can never be true freedom of speech, and without decentralization the network will be vulnerable to attack. Communications by Freenet nodes are encrypted and are \"routed-through\" other nodes to make it extremely difficult to determine who is requesting the information and what its content is. Users contribute to the network by giving bandwidth and a portion of their hard drive (called the \"data store\") for storing files. Unlike other peer-to-peer file sharing networks, Freenet does not let the user control what is stored in the data store. Instead, files are kept or deleted depending on how popular they are, with the least popular being discarded to make way for newer or more popular content. Files in the data store are encrypted to reduce the likelihood of prosecution by persons wishing to censor Freenet content. The network can be used in a number of different ways and isn't restricted to just sharing files like other peer-to-peer networks. It acts more like an Internet within an Internet. For example Freenet can be used for: * Publishing websites or 'freesites' * Communicating via message boards * Content distribution * Sending email messages Unlike many cutting edge projects, Freenet long ago escaped the science lab, it has been downloaded by over 2 million users since the project started, and it is used for the distribution of censored information all over the world including countries such as China and the Middle East.

These games are often called 4 X's from the main phases found in the games, eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate. If you haven't heard of them, other games which are a bit similar include, Civilisation, Hero's of Might and Magic and Starcraft.

It is actively developed by a very large international community and is translated in over 30 languages. TikiWiki can be used to create all sorts of Web applications, sites, portals, knowledge base, intranets, and extranets.  TikiWiki offers a very large number of features \"out-of-the-box\", arguably more than any other Open Source Web Application. Highly configurable & modular, all the features are optional and administered via a web-based interface.  Major features include a robust wiki engine, news articles, discussion forums, newsletters, blogs, a file/image gallery, bug & issue tracker (form generator), a links directory, polls/surveys and quizzes, a FAQ, a banner management system, a calendar, maps, Mobile Tiki (PDA, VoiceXML and WAP access), RSS feeds, a category system, tags, an advanced themeing engine (Smarty), a workflow engine, a spreadsheet, live support, Shoutbox, inter-user messages, a menu generator, an advanced user, group and permission system, internal search engine, external authentication support, and much much more. How is TikiWiki CMS/Groupware different? According to various indicators, TikiWiki CMS/Groupware is, community-wise, top-tier amongst wiki software, and towards the top of the second tier as a CMS, after the \"big 4\" (Drupal, Joomla!, WordPress & Plone). It is of course unique as a blend of both wiki software and more general purpose CMS.  http://www.ohloh.net/tags/wiki  http://www.siteground.com/compare_best_wiki.htm  http://www.ohloh.net/tags/content_management_system http://tikiwiki.org/CMS+Landscape", "logo_bg": null, "logo_image": null, "mailing_list": "http://dev.tikiwiki.org/GSOC+Ideas+2009", "name": "TikiWiki CMS/Groupware", "num_projects": 4, "tagline": null, "technologies": null, "topics": null, "website": null, "year": 2009},{"category": null, "description": "Mailing List: turbogears@googlegroups.com\n   TurboGears is a next generation web framework written in python.

The project was started by Sam Hart over ten years ago and currently maintains and develops three software programs. The programs take their name from Tux, the Linux mascot. Tux Paint, led by Bill Kendrick, is an award-winning and widely used artistic graphics program. Tux Paint is enjoyable for everyone from the youngest children capable of using computers up through adults. Tux Math (originally written by Bill Kendrick, now led by David Bruce and Tim Holy) is a video game-style math drill program.  It covers basic math operations up through topics such as negative numbers, factoring, and order-of-operations exercises.  Tux Typing (originally written by Sam Hart, now led by David Bruce) offers word typing practice in the setting of two video game-type activities, as well as phrase and sentence typing for older students.  All three programs are SDL-based C apps, licensed under the GPL.  They are developed natively on Linux and are included in all major desktop distributions, as well as non-Linux Free Software collections such as the FreeBSD Ports Collection and the MacPorts project for OS-X.  Builds are also available for Microsoft Windows and BeOS.  The aim is to avoid specific platform dependencies so the programs can be made available as widely as possible, including the computing environments that children are most likely to actually encounter in schools.
